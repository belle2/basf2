# Belle II Analysis Software Framework (basf2)

This repository contains the main software of the
[Belle II experiment](https://www.belle2.org/).

It is used in all aspects of the data-processing chain, such as

- generating simulated data,
- unpacking of real raw data,
- reconstruction of particle decays (tracking, clustering, ...)

and high-level "analysis" reconstruction (such as applying selection criteria,
vertex fitting, ...).

Head to [our documentation](software.belle2.org/) (members only) to learn about
how to use basf2. If you are unsure about which version of the documentation to
read, click on `release-xx-xx-xx (recommended)`. We
recommend you to start with the lessons of the `online book` if you are just
starting out.
