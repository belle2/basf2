# Belle II Analysis Software Framework (basf2)

This repository contains the main software of the
[Belle II experiment](https://www.belle2.org/).

It is used in all aspects of the data-processing chain, such as

- unpacking of real raw data,
- generating simulated data,
- reconstruction of particle decays (tracking, clustering, ...)

and high-level "analysis" reconstruction (such as applying selection criteria,
vertex fitting, ...).

In addition to the code of this repository, the Belle II tools
([members only](https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2/repos/tools/browse))
and the Belle II externals
([members only](https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2/repos/externals/browse))
are required to run the software. They will be released as open source soon.

Note that this repository only contains part of the history of the code. Belle II
members can include the remaining history using `b2code-history`.

Head to [our documentation](software.belle2.org/) (members only) to learn about
how to use basf2. If you are unsure about which version of the documentation to
read, click on `release-xx-xx-xx (recommended)`. We
recommend you to start with the lessons of the `Beginners' tutorials` if you are
just starting out.

More information about the core software can be found in the
[2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04299).
