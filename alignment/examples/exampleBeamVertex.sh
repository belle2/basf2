# This script demonstrates some features of Millepede calibration
# in basf2 and how to run it (also with CAF). It
#
# - tries to create an empty local database
# - generates 2 simulated samples for alignment: BBar decays and e+e- -> mu+mu- (with ip+vertex constraint)
# - misaligns one PXD half shell in a local database
# - runs simultaneous alignment of VXD half shells and primary vertex in 3 ways:
#    1) with CAF using the predefined scenario
#    2) with CAF with more control but more code to set up things
#    3) with command line tool "millepede_calibration" based on predefined scenarios, without CAF
#    
# Please note that 3) will actually update the local DB. 1) and 2) have all outputs in own folders

n1=100 # Num events of MuMu pairs from IP (QED)
n2=100 # Num events of Single muons from BBar events
