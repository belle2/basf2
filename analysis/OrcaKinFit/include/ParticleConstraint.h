/// Abstract base class for constraints of kinematic fits
    /**
     * This class defines the minimal functionality any constraint class must provide.
     * First of all a constraint should know on with particles (or FitObject) it is applied.
     * Where as for example a constraint on the total transvese momentum takes into
     * account all particles in the event, an invariant mass constraint usually applies only
     * to a subset of particles.
     *
     * The particle list is implemented as a vector containing pointers to objects derived
     * from ParticleFitObject and can be either set a whole (setFOList) or enlarged by adding
     * a single ParticleFitObject (addToFOList).
     *
     * From the four--momenta of all concerned fit objects the constraint has to be able
     * to calculate its current value (getValue). Constraints should be formulated such that
     * a value of zero corresponds to a perfectly fulfilled constraint.
     *
     * In order to find a solution to the constrained minimisation problem, fit algorithms
     * usually need the first order derivatives of the constraint with respect to the fit
     * parameters. Since many constraints can be most easily expressed in terms of E, px, py, pz,
     * the constraints supply their derivatives w.r.t. these parameters. If a FitObject uses
     * a different parametrisation, it is its own task to provide the additional derivatives
     * of  E, px, py, pz w.r.t. the parameters of the FitObject. Thus it is easily possible
     * to use FitObjects with different kinds of parametrisations under the same constraint.
     * Some fit algorithms also need the second derivatives of the constraint,
     * i.e. the NewtonFitter.
     *
     * First and second order derivatives of each constraint can be added directly to the
     * global covariance matrix containing the derivatives of all constraints w.r.t. to all
     * parameters (add1stDerivativesToMatrix, add2ndDerivativesToMatrix). This requires the
     * constraint to know its position in the overall list of constraints (globalNum).
