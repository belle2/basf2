Continuum suppression
=====================

Documentation about continuum suppression framework is not yet migrated from our `confluence page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Continuum+Suppression+Framework>`_. Please go there.
If you have time to do the migration, feel free to take `agira ticket <https://agira.desy.de/browse/BII-2978>`_. In this case you might need nice guid on Sphinx documentation: :ref:`doctools` .
