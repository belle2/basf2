Kinematic-fitting convenience functions
=======================================

The KinematicFitter is a global fitting tool to constrain the 4-momentum of the
provided particle to be the same as the 4-momentum of the beam. 

.. note::

        A ``4C`` constraint means that both the energy and the 3-D momentum are constrained to the beam.
        In default settings, the 4-momentum of the beam is taken without uncertainties.
