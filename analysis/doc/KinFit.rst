Kinematic-fitting convenience functions
=======================================

The `Orca kinematic fitter<https://github.com/tferber/OrcaKinfit>`_ is a global fitting tool.

A typical use-case would be to to constrain the 4-momentum of all particles provided to the 4-momentum of the beam. 
This is a "4C" fit (four constraints).

.. note::

        By default, the 4-momentum of the beam is taken without uncertainties.
