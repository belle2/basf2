Kinematic fitting convenience functions
=======================================

The KinematicFitter is a global fitting tool to constrain the 4-momentum of the
provided particle to be the same as the 4-momentum of the beam. A `4C` constraint
means that both the energy and the 3-D momentum are constrained to coincide with
the ones of the beam. In default settings, the 4-momentum of the beam is taken
as without uncertainties.
