MC matching
-----------

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First, you must run it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MCMatching relates ``Particle`` and ``MCParticle`` objects. 

.. important:: 
        Most MC matching variables will have non-trivial values only if the :b2:mod:`MCMatcherParticles` module is actually executed.
        It can be executed by adding the module to your path, there is a `modularAnalysis.matchMCTruth` convenience function to do this.


~~~~
Core
~~~~

MC matching at Belle II returns two important pieces of information: 
the true PDG id of the particle :b2:var:`mcPDG`, 
and an error flag :b2:var:`mcErrors`. 

Both variables will have non-trivial values only if the MCMatching module, 
which relates composite ``Particle`` (s) and ``MCParticle`` (s), is executed. 
:b2:var:`mcPDG` is set to the PDG code of the first common mother ``MCParticle`` of the daughters of this ``Particle``.


.. b2-variables::
        :variables: mcPDG,mcErrors
        :noindex:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Extra variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several extra variables relating to MCMatching. 
Many are defined for convenience and can be recreated logically from :b2:var:`mcPDG` and :b2:var:`mcErrors`.
Some extra variables are provided externally, for example :b2:var:`isCloneTrack` from the tracking-level MC matching.

.. b2-variables::
        :variables: isSignal,isExtendedSignal,isSignalAcceptWrongFSPs,isSignalAcceptMissingNeutrino,isSignalAcceptMissingMassive,isSignalAcceptMissingGamma,isSignalAcceptMissing,isWrongCharge,isMisidentified,isCloneTrack,isOrHasCloneTrack,genNStepsToDaughter(i),genNMissingDaughter(PDG)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The error flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The error flag :b2:var:`mcErrors` is a bit set where each bit flag describes
 a different kind of discrepancy between reconstruction and ``MCParticle``. 
 The individual flags are described by the ``MCMatching::MCErrorFlags`` enum.
 A value of mcErrors equal to 0 indicates perfect reconstruction (signal). 
 Usually candidates with only FSR photons missing are also considered as signal, 
 so you might want to ignore the corresponding ``c_MissFSR`` flag.
 The same is true for ``c_MissingResonance``, which is set for any missing composite particle (e.g. :math:`K_1`, but also :math:`D^{*0}`).


==============================  ================================================================================================
Flag                            Explanation
==============================  ================================================================================================
 c_Correct       = 0             This Particle and all its daughters are perfectly reconstructed. 
 c_MissFSR       = 1             A Final State Radiation (FSR) photon is not reconstructed (based on MCParticle: :c_IsFSRPhoton). 
 c_MissingResonance = 2          The associated MCParticle decay contained additional non-final-state particles (e.g. a rho)
                                 that weren't reconstructed. This is probably O.K. in most cases. 
 c_DecayInFlight = 4             A Particle was reconstructed from the secondary decay product of the actual particle. 
                                 This means that a wrong hypothesis was used to reconstruct it, which e.g. for tracks might mean
                                 a pion hypothesis was used for a secondary electron. 
 c_MissNeutrino  = 8             A neutrino is missing (not reconstructed). 
 c_MissGamma     = 16            A photon (not FSR) is missing (not reconstructed). 
 c_MissMassiveParticle = 32      A generated massive FSP is missing (not reconstructed). 
 c_MissKlong     = 64            A Klong is missing (not reconstructed).  
 c_MisID = 128                   One of the charged final state particles is mis-identified (wrong signed PDG code).
 c_AddedWrongParticle = 256      A non-FSP Particle has wrong PDG code, meaning one of the daughters (or their daughters)
                                 belongs to another Particle. 
 c_InternalError = 512           There was an error in MC matching. Not a valid match. Might indicate fake/background 
                                 track or cluster. 
 c_MissPHOTOS    = 1024          A photon created by PHOTOS was not reconstructed (based on MCParticle: :c_IsPHOTOSPhoton). 
 c_AddedRecoBremsPhoton = 2048   A photon added with the bremsstrahlung recovery tools (correctBrems or correctBremsBelle) has 
                                 no MC particle assigned, or it doesn't belong to the decay chain of the corrected lepton mother

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example of use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The two variables together allow the user not only to distinguish signal (correctly reconstructed) 
and background (incorrectly reconstructed) candidates, but also to study and identify various types of physics background 
(e.g. mis-ID, partly reconstructed decays, ...). 
To select candidates that have a certain flag set, you can use bitwise and to select only this flag from :b2:var:`mcErrors` 
and check if this value is non-zero: ``(mcErrors & MCMatching::c_MisID) != 0`` .
For use in a ``TTree`` selector, you'll need to use the integer value of the flag instead:

.. code-block:: cpp

        ntuple->Draw("M", "(mcErrors & 128) != 0")

You can also make use of ``MCMatching::explainFlags()`` which prints a human-readable 
list of flags present in a given bitset. Can also be used in both C++ and python:

.. code-block:: python

        import basf2
        from ROOT import Belle2, gInterpreter
        gInterpreter.ProcessLine('#include "analysis/utility/MCMatching.h"')
        print(Belle2.MCMatching.explainFlags(a_weird_mcError_number)) 


If instead only binary decision (1 = signal, 0 = background) is needed, 
then for convenience one can use :b2:var:`isSignal` (or :b2:var:`isSignalAcceptMissingNeutrino` for semileptonic decays).

.. code-block:: python
        
        from modularAnalysis import variablesToNtuple
        variablesToNtuple("X:mycandidates -> Y Z", variables = ["isSignal"] + other_interesting_variables)
        
assuming you have reconstructed :code:`X -> Y Z` :

.. code-block:: python

        from modularAnalysis import applyCuts
        applyCuts('X:myCandidates', 'isSignal==1')

----------------------------------------------
MC decay finder module :b2:mod:`MCDecayFinder`
----------------------------------------------

Analysis module to search for a given decay in the list of generated particles ``MCParticle``.

The module can be used for:

* Determination of the number of generated decays for efficiency studies, especially in the case of inclusive decays (e.g.: What's the generated number of :math:`B \to D^0 X` decays?).
* Matched MC decays as input for a truth matching module.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Steering file snippet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
.. code-block:: python

  import basf2
  
  # Create main path
  main = basf2.create_path()
  
  # Modules to generate events, etc.
  ...

  import modularAnalysis as ma
  # Search for B+ decaying to anti-D0 + anything, where the anti-D0 decays to K+ pi-.
  # Ignore additional photons emitted in the anti-D0 decay. Charge conjugated decays
  # are matched, too. If there is a match found, save to ParticleList 'B+:testB'
  ma.findMCDecay('B+:testB', 'B+ =direct=> [anti-D0 =direct=> K+ pi-] ... ?gamma ?nu', path=main)  
  
  # Modules which can use the matched decays saved as Particle in the ParticleList 'B+:testB'
  ...
 

   .. warning:: 
        `isSignal` of output particle, `'B+:testB'` in above case, is not related to given decay string for now.
	For example, even if one uses ``...``, ``?gamma``, or ``?nu``, `isSignal` will be 0.
	So please use a specific isSignal* variable, `isSignalAcceptMissing` in this case.

For more information and examples how to use the decay strings correctly, please see :ref:`DecayString` and :ref:`Grammar_for_custom_MCMatching`.

MC decay string

Analysis module to search for a generator-level decay string for given particle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using decay hashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The use of decay hashes is demonstrated in :code:`B2A502-WriteOutDecayHash.py` and :code:`B2A503-ReadDecayHash.py`.

:code:`B2A502-WriteOutDecayHash.py` creates one ROOT file, via `modularAnalysis.variablesToNtuple`
containing the requested variables including the two decay hashes, and a second root file containing the two decay hashes
and the full decay string.
The decay strings can be related to the candidates that they are associated with by matching up the decay hashes.
An example of this using python is shown in :code:`B2A503-ReadDecayHash.py`.

.. code-block:: python

  path.add_module('ParticleMCDecayString', listName='my_particle_list', fileName='my_hashmap.root')

This will produce a file with all of the decay strings in it, along with the decayHash 
(hashes the MC decay string of the mother particle) and decayHashExtended 
(hashes the decay string of the mother and daughter particles).  
The mapping of hashes to full MC decay strings is stored in a ROOT file determined by the fileName parameter.

Then the variables ``extraInfo(decayHash)`` and ``extraInfo(decayHashExtended)`` are available in the `VariableManager`.

------------------
Tau decay MC modes
------------------

A special case is the decay of generated tau lepton pairs. For their study, it is useful to call the function ``labelTauPairMC`` in the steering file.

.. code-block:: python

        from modularAnalysis import labelTauPairMC
        labelTauPairMC()

.. b2-variables::
        :variables: tauPlusMcMode,tauMinusMcMode,tauPlusMCProng,tauMinusMCProng

Using MC information, ``labelTauPairMC`` identifies if the generated event is a tau pair decay.

The variables ``tauPlusMCProng`` and ``tauMinusMCProng`` stores the prong (number of final state charged particles) coming from each one of the generated tau leptons. If the event is not a tau pair decay, the value in each one of these variables will be 0.

The channel number will be stored in the variables ``tauPlusMcMode``, and ``tauMinusMcMode`` (one for the positive and the other for the negative) according to the following table:

============  ===============================================  ============  ==================================================
MC mode       Decay channel                                    MC mode       Decay channel
