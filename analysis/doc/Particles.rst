Particles
=========

Particles in basf2 are created from reconstructed dataobjects: Tracks, tracking vertices (V0s), ECLClusters, and KLMClusters.
The `Particle`_ class, provides a unified way to treat different objects at a high level interpreting them as physical particles.
All of the `Particle`_ s in an event that fall within certain criteria are collected into `ParticleList`_ s.

The Belle II physics performance group already has several predefined `ParticleList`_ s.
To use them you need to use functions described in the standard particle lists.

.. toctree:: StandardParticles

Creation of new particle lists by combination of particles is essential part of almost any analysis job.
The syntax used during this procedure is the :doc:`DecayString` and is described below:

.. toctree:: DecayString

It is often desirable to apply selections to `ParticleList`_ s, and events.
This is done with cut strings.

.. toctree:: CutStrings
