Modular analysis convenience functions
======================================

The general idea of ``basf2`` modules is described in the section on :ref:`general_modpath`.
The analysis package provides pre-defined python wrapper functions designed to simplify users python code.
For vertex-fitter functions see the later section on :ref:`analysis_vertexfitting`.

There are also some more specialised python wrapper functions for dealing with photons.
