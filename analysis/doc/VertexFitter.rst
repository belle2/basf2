Vertex Fitter
=============

Documentation about the vertex fitter is not yet migrated from our `confluence page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Physics+VertexFitter>`_ and is quite poor in general.
If you have time to do the migration or improve it, feel free to take `agira ticket <https://agira.desy.de/browse/BII-3602>`_. In this case you might need nice guid on Sphinx documentation: :ref:`doctools` .
