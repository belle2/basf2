Vertex Fitter
=============

This page summarises the development status for various vertex fitting algorithms and modules within basf2.

Ongoing issues, development threads, and open projects can be found on `JIRA <https://agira.desy.de/>`_ under the `VertexFitting <https://agira.desy.de/browse/BII-3602?jql=labels%253DVertexFitting>`_ label.

Interfaces to Vertex related functions and modules are in :doc:`Vertex`.


Use cases
---------

#. Vertex fit of multiple particles
#. Vertex fit of multiple particles with mass constraint
#. Vertex fit of multiple particles with direction constraint
#. Fit of decay chains (with constraints)
#. Vertex fit of a V0 (with constraints)
#. Vertex fit of tag B (with constraints)
#. Momentum fit of a :math:`\pi^0`
#. Kinematic fits of multiple particles with full or partial soft or hard (four momentum) constraints.
#. Kinematic fits of multiple particles with full or partial soft or hard (four momentum) constraints with partially or completely missing particles.

Available vertex fit libraries
------------------------------

RAVE
~~~~

Rave is a Kalman-based vertex fitter implemented as an external library (CMS vertexing library)

* **Developers/basf2 maintainer** None / Luigi Li Gioi

* **Physics Use Case**

  * Standard kinematic fit
  * Mass fit from mother 7x7 error matrix
  * Refit of the daughters
  * Geometric fit
  * Tag Vertex

* **basf2 implementation**

  * Kinematic fit included in ParticleVertexFitModule
  * Module for geometric fit not available but can be easily developed
  * TagVertex
  * V0Finder vertex fit implemented in tracking code

* **Issues**

 * Very slow: external libraries (Root) and shell
 * no developers

**RAVE: global**

  * RAVE algorithm to be tested
  * RAVE API to be developed and tested
  * RAVE API kinematic constraints to be tested and/or debugged

**RAVE: progressive**

  * Algorithm should be developed inside RAVE
  * Progressive: References are missing

**General RAVE development**

  * memory consumption
  * documentation
  * kinematic fit constraints: test and debug
  * rave is available at github `github <https://github.com/rave-package/rave/>`_
  * building/testing environment at `RAVE page <https://travis-ci.org/rave-package/rave>`_


GFRave
~~~~~~

Implementation of RAVE in Genfit for V0 finding.

* **Developers/basf2 maintainer** None / Luigi Li Gioi

* **Physics Use Case** 
  * V0 Fit

* **basf2 implementation** 
  * V0Finder

KFit
~~~~

Port of the Belle vertex fitter.

* **Developers/basf2 maintainer** J. Tanaka / Luigi Li Gioi

* **Physics Use Case**

  * Standard Kinematic Fit
  * Mass fit from daughters
  * Constrain the sum of four momentum of all final particles to that of e+ e- beams

* **basf2 implementation**

  * Kinemeatic fit available in ParticleVertexFitModule

* **Issues**

  * 4C constraint not completed

TreeFitter
~~~~~~~~~~

(`Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 552 (2005) 566â€“575 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2005.06.078>`_)
(`Belle 2 Article <https://docs.belle2.org/record/841>`_)

This is a progressive decay chain fitting tool from BaBar and LHCb, based on a
Kalman Filter. More detail can be found in the page :doc:`TreeFitter`.

* **Developers/basf2 maintainers** Francesco Tenchini, Jo-Frederik Krohn

* **Physics Use Case**

  * Fit of the entire decay tree
  * Fit of neutral-rich decay chains
  * Access to the full observable covariance matrix

* **basf2 implementation**

  * Now outperforming RAVE/KFit

OrcaKinFit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kinematic fitter implementation, based on a fork of MarlinKinFit with modifications (remove all ILC dependency).

* **Developers/basf2 maintainer** Torben Ferber

* **Physics Use Case**

  * Momentum constraints (soft and hard) with and without (partially) missing
    particles. Arbitrary constraints (e.g., recoil mass: `BELLE2-NOTE-PH-2017-002
    <https://docs.belle2.org/record/483?ln=en>`_)

TagV
~~~~

Module to perform the Btag vertex geometric fit using the RAVE adaptive vertex fitting algorithm. It takes as input the tracks
of the Rest Of Event. More info about interface in :b2:mod:`TagVertex`, `vertex.TagV`

* **Developers/basf2 maintener** - / -

* **Physics Use Case**

  * TDCPV measurements
