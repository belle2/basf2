Vertex (and kinematic) fitting
==============================

There are a number of vertex-fitting and kinematic fitter libraries interfaced and available for use in basf2.

By default, :doc:`TreeFitter` is recommended even for simple single-vertex use-cases, however there are use cases where a better-performing or specialist tool is needed.

.. toctree:: TreeFitter
.. toctree:: OtherVertexFitters

These fitters can be added to your basf2 path using a set of the convenient pre-defined python wrapper functions.
