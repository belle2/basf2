Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

There have been improvements and additions to the variables available in the variable manager.
Some older, unhelpful, or deprecated variables have been removed, but this should be less than previous major releases.
As usual, please ask at https://questions.belle2.org if anything is unclear or your favourite variable seems to have been removed.  There is likely a good reason.

* Addition of `vertex information <vertex_information>`, `flight distance information <flight_information>`, and MC hierarchy information (:b2:var:`mcMother` and :b2:var:`mcDaughter` metavariables).

* Some variables that check lists (:b2:var:`isInList` and :b2:var:`isDaughterOfList`).

* Additions and fixes to the `RestOfEvent variables <restOfEventVariables>`.
  Kinematics related to the `RestOfEvent` now obey the reference frame syntax (e.g. :b2:var:`useCMSFrame`).

* Bug-fixes to L1 trigger information (prescales are now available in :b2:var:`L1PSNMBitPrescale`), and event level tracking information.

* Special variables to return the :math:`\phi` angle difference between two daughters (:b2:var:`daughterDiffOfPhi` c.f. :b2:var:`daughterDiffOf`).

* **Removal** of the PhysicsTriggerVariables (all of which were experimental and only intended for use in the study of triggers).

New Modular Analysis Tools
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* Multiple particle lists may be written to the same file with `VariablesToNtuple <v2nt>`.

* A new improved `RestOfEvent` which takes particle lists as input. The syntax is mostly backward-compatible, but please check the `updated documentation <RestOfEvent>` if your analysis relies on this functionality.
  In addition some new features are added (such as nested `RestOfEvent`).

* Separation of `EventShape <eventShapeVariables>` and `EventKinematics <eventKinematicsVariables>` and addition of many global event shape variables based on particle lists. 

  .. seealso::

Fitters
+++++++

* Many improvements to **TreeFitter**, which is now the recommended vertex fitter almost all use cases, even for simple vertices with two tracks.
  Please refer to the `TreeFitter documentation <treeFitter>` for full details.

  .. seealso::
 	`This TreeFitter tutorial <https://confluence.desy.de/download/attachments/99515171/slides_oct_2018.pdf>`_ (October 2018).

* Bug fixes to OrcaKinFit.

* KFit is now accessible from other `basf2` modules.

Loading V0 Particles
++++++++++++++++++++

* When loading V0 particles (i.e. :math:`K_S^0`, :math:`\Lambda^0`, or converted photons) using the ParticleLoader (`fillParticleList`) you must now specify the daughters in a decay string.
  For example, to load :math:`\Lambda^0\to p^+\pi^-` decays from V0s:

  .. code-block:: python

	from modularAnalysis import fillParticleList
        fillParticleList('Lambda0 -> p+ pi-', '0.9 < M < 1.3', path=mypath)

Tutorials and Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++

* The style of many of the tutorial scripts have been updated to assist with and provide examples of these new changes.
