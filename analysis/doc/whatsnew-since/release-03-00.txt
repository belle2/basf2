Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* Deprecated :b2:var:`clusterHypothesis` following changes to the ECLCluster storage on mdst. 
  Please use :b2:var:`clusterHasNPhotons` and :b2:var:`clusterHasNeutralHadron`.

* Removed ClusterHadronIntensity and clusterUniqueID.

Modules
+++++++

* Removal of the unsupported ECLClusterInfoModule.


Standard Particle Lists
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* Updated V0 lists by making them explicitly call the appropriate vertex fit.

* Fixed a bug in the merged Lambda list, which used an incorrect mass window.

* Updated charged standard PID cut values to reflect the correct efficiencies.
  This recovers the efficiency loss reported in :issue:`BIIDP-1065`.

Unit Tests
++++++++++

* Added unit tests for the standard V0 lists.

Variables
+++++++++

* The function to create variable aliases for particles selected from a decay
  string has been fixed and extended to allow better
  customization (:issue:`BII-4437`)

  .. seealso::
     `variables.utils.create_aliases_for_selected()`

Modules
+++++++

* Fixed a bug in the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` module: When
  ``allowMultiRank=True`` there always at least two candidates with rank of one,
  even if they didn't have the same variable value (:issue:`BII-4460`)

  This affects all users of `modularAnalysis.rankByLowest()` and
  `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest()` if they passed ``allowMultiRank=True``

* Removal of the unsupported ECLClusterInfoModule.

FEI
+++

* Removed the backward compatibility layer (``pid_renaming_oktober_2017``). 
  Only FEI trainings from release-02 are supported. Please update to ``FEIv4_2018_MC9_release_02_00_01`` or newer.
