Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* The variables ``mcDX``, ``mcDY``, ``mcDZ`` are now deprecated, 
  because they are duplicates of :b2:var:`mcX`, :b2:var:`mcY` and :b2:var:`mcZ`.
  A warning had been added in documentation.

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`eclClusterSpecialTrackMatched` to check if
  any track related to an ECL cluster satisfies certain criteria. It can be used
  to apply an individual track-cluster matching.

* Added missing error variables :b2:var:`DeltaZErr` and :b2:var:`DeltaBoostErr`. 
  Fixed bug in TagV error functions.

* Replaced :b2:var:`pValue` (tracking variable) with :b2:var:`chiProb` (vertexing variable) 
  in the collection of vertexing variables.

* Added two new helicity variables: 
  :b2:var:`cosHelicityAngleIfRefFrameIsTheDaughter` and :b2:var:`cosAcoplanarityAngleIfRefFrameIsTheMother`. 
* Replaced pValue (tracking variable) with chiProb (vertexing variable) in the vertexing variable collection.

TreeFitter
++++++++++

* Fix the :math:`\phi`-dependent loss of performance for displaced vertices (:issue:`BII-4753`).  

Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++

* Default Expert (testing mode) does not create repositories and does not save weight files locally. 
  It only loads the payloads directly from the database using the database payload names
  as mva identifiers.
