Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`eclClusterSpecialTrackMatched` to check if
  any track related to an ECL cluster satisfies certain criteria. It can be used
  to apply an individual track-cluster matching.

* Added missing error variable DeltaZErr and DeltaBoostErr. Fixed bug in TagV error functions.

* Replaced pValue (tracking variable) with chiProb (vertexing variable) in the vertexing variable collection.

Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++

* Default Expert (testing mode) does not create repositories and does not save weight files locally. 
  It only loads the payloads directly from the database using the database payload names
  as mva identifiers.
