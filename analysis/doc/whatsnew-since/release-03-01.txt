Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* The variables ``mcDX``, ``mcDY``, ``mcDZ`` are now deprecated, 
  because they are duplicates of :b2:var:`mcX`, :b2:var:`mcY` and :b2:var:`mcZ`.
  A warning had been added in documentation.

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`eclClusterSpecialTrackMatched` to check if
  any track related to an ECL cluster satisfies certain criteria. It can be used
  to apply an individual track-cluster matching.

* Added missing error variable DeltaZErr and DeltaBoostErr. Fixed bug in TagV error functions.

* Replaced pValue (tracking variable) with chiProb (vertexing variable) in the vertexing variable collection.
