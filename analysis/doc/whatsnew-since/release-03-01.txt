Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* The event-based variable ``KLMEnergy`` is removed. It is completely meaningless (:issue:`BII-5002`).

* The variables ``mcDX``, ``mcDY``, ``mcDZ`` are now deprecated, 
  because they are duplicates of :b2:var:`mcX`, :b2:var:`mcY` and :b2:var:`mcZ`.
  A warning had been added in documentation.

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`eclClusterSpecialTrackMatched` to check if
  any track related to an ECL cluster satisfies certain criteria. It can be used
  to apply an individual track-cluster matching.

* Added missing error variable DeltaZErr and DeltaBoostErr. Fixed bug in TagV error functions.

* Replaced pValue (tracking variable) with chiProb (vertexing variable) in the vertexing variable collection.

* Added the meta variables :b2:var:`averageValueInList` and
  :b2:var:`medianValueInList` which calculate the arithmetic mean and median of
  a given variable in a given particle list.

TreeFitter
++++++++++

* Fix the :math:`\phi`-dependent loss of performance for displaced vertices (:issue:`BII-4753`).  

Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++

* Default Expert (testing mode) does not create repositories and does not save weight files locally. 
  It only loads the payloads directly from the database using the database payload names
  as mva identifiers.

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

* Added IP tube constraint to KFit
