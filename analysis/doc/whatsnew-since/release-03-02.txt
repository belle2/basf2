Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* Added a variable that returns the distance between a KLMCluster and its associated Track :b2:var:`klmClusterTrackDistance`

* Access to tag vertexing quality indicators for resolution function study, :b2:var:`TagVNDF`, :b2:var:`TagVChi2`, and :b2:var:`TagVChi2IP`.

* Statistically correct combination of p-values :b2:var:`pValueCombination`

* chi2 and ndf from KFit vertices stored as extraInfo

* Added :b2:var:`trackFitHypothesisPDG` which returns the PDG code of the successfull track fit hypothesis 
  that was used to create this particle (that might be different from the PDG code of the particle list)

* Added variables for 2D Armenteros-Podolanski plot, :b2:var:`ArmenterosLongitudinalMomentumAsymmetry`, 
  :b2:var:`ArmenterosDaughter1Qt`, and :b2:var:`ArmenterosDaughter2Qt`

Modules
+++++++

* Added the new module AllParticleCombiner which is also available via the
  function `modularAnalysis.combineAllParticles`. It creates a new Particle as
  the combination of all unique Particles from the passed input ParticleLists.

Modular Analysis
++++++++++++++++

* A new boolean argument has been added to the function
  `modularAnalysis.buildRestOfEvent`. It is called `belle_sources` and should be
  switched to True (default is False) if you are analyzing converted Belle MC or
  data. It triggers the ROE to be constructed from all tracks and from Belle's
  specific gamma:mdst list.
* Added signal region function `modularAnalysis.signalRegion`. By default, this function enables a new variable ``isSignalRegion`` and excludes the defined area when processing is done on data.

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

* The parameter confidenceLevel of the module ParticleVertexFitter now always
  rejects the particle candidates with a p-value lower than the specified one.
  Specifically, setting confidenceLevel to 0 does not reject candidates with
  p-value equal to 0 anymore. Thus, the meaning of this parameter is now
  the same as for the module TreeFitter.

Modules
+++++++

* ParticleLoader can load :doc:`RestOfEvent` as a particle 
  using a new function `modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`.
  This ROE particle can be combined with any other particle or written down 
  using usual variables. 
  Another option is to load missing momentum as a particle by supplementing 
  ``useMissing = True`` argument to the function, mentioned above.

Standard V0s Lists
++++++++++++++++++

* Updated V0 lists. The standard list became the merged list, a combined list of particles
  coming from V0 objects merged with a list of particles combined using the analysis ParticleCombiner module.
  `stdKshorts(prioritiseV0, path)` returns a Ks list called `K_S0:merged`
  `stdLambdas(prioritiseV0, path)` returns a Lambda list called `Lambda0:merged`
  mergedKshorts() and mergedLambdas() are now deprecated, and return the standard lists.
  
* The definition of the standard V0 lists slightly changed. 
  For Lambdas, the modularAnalysis.markDuplicate() function is now used to detect duplicates
  among the same list (V0 and ReconstructDecay), rather than between different lists.
  For Ks, the modularAnalysis.markDuplicate() function is no longer used.
