Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* Added a variable that returns the distance between a KLMCluster and its associated Track :b2:var:`klmClusterTrackDistance`

* Access to tag vertexing quality indicators for resolution function study, :b2:var:`TagVNDF`, :b2:var:`TagVChi2`, and :b2:var:`TagVChi2IP`.

* Statistically correct combination of p-values :b2:var:`pValueCombination`

* chi2 and ndf from KFit vertices stored as extraInfo

* Added :b2:var:`trackFitHypothesisPDG` which returns the PDG code of the successfull track fit hypothesis 
  that was used to create this particle (that might be different from the PDG code of the particle list)

* Added variables for 2D Armenteros-Podolanski plot, :b2:var:`ArmenterosLongitudinalMomentumAsymmetry`, 
  :b2:var:`ArmenterosDaughter1Qt`, and :b2:var:`ArmenterosDaughter2Qt`
* fall-back value changed from zero to NaN for several track variables

Modules
+++++++

* Added the new module AllParticleCombiner which is also available via the
  function `modularAnalysis.combineAllParticles`. It creates a new Particle as
  the combination of all unique Particles from the passed input ParticleLists.

* ParticleLoader can load :doc:`RestOfEvent` as a particle
  using a new function `modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`.
  This ROE particle can be combined with any other particle or written down
  using usual variables.
  Another option is to load missing momentum as a particle by supplementing
  ``useMissing = True`` argument to the function, mentioned above.

Modular Analysis
++++++++++++++++

* A new boolean argument has been added to the function
  `modularAnalysis.buildRestOfEvent`. It is called `belle_sources` and should be
  switched to True (default is False) if you are analyzing converted Belle MC or
  data. It triggers the ROE to be constructed from all tracks and from Belle's
  specific gamma:mdst list.

* Added signal region function `modularAnalysis.signalRegion`. By default,
  this function enables a new variable ``isSignalRegion`` and excludes the
  defined area when processing is done on data.

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

* The parameter confidenceLevel of the module ParticleVertexFitter now always
  rejects the particle candidates with a p-value lower than the specified one.
  Specifically, setting confidenceLevel to 0 does not reject candidates with
  p-value equal to 0 anymore. Thus, the meaning of this parameter is now
  the same as for the module TreeFitter.
