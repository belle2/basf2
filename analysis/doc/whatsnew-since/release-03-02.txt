Changes in the analysis package

Modules
+++++++

* ParticleLoader can load :doc:`RestOfEvent` as a particle 
  using a new function `modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`.
  This ROE particle can be combined with any other particle or written down 
  using usual variables. 
  Another option is to load missing momentum as a particle by supplementing 
  ``useMissing = True`` argument to the function, mentioned above.
