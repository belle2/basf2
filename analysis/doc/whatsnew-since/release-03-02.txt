Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* Added a variable that returns the distance between a KLMCluster and its associated Track :b2:var:`klmClusterTrackDistance`

* Access to tag vertexing quality indicators for resolution function study, :b2:var:`TagVNDF`, :b2:var:`TagVChi2`, and :b2:var:`TagVChi2IP`.

* Statistically correct combination of p-values :b2:var:`pValueCombination`

* chi2 and ndf from KFit vertices stored as extraInfo

Modules
+++++++

* Added the new module AllParticleCombiner which is also available via the
  function `modularAnalysis.combineAllParticles`. It creates a new Particle as
  the combination of all unique Particles from the passed input ParticleLists.

Modular Analysis
++++++++++++++++

* A new boolean argument has been added to the function
  `modularAnalysis.buildRestOfEvent`. It is called `belle_sources` and should be
  switched to True (default is False) if you are analyzing converted Belle MC or
  data. It triggers the ROE to be constructed from all tracks and from Belle's
  specific gamma:mdst list.
* Added signal region function `modularAnalysis.signalRegion`. By default, this function enables a new variable ``isSignalRegion`` and excludes the defined area when processing is done on data.
