Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

TreeFitter
++++++++++

* Fix the :math:`\phi`-dependent loss of performance for displaced vertices (:issue:`BII-4753`).  

Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++

* Default Expert (testing mode) does not create repositories and does not save weight files locally. 
  It only loads the payloads directly from the database using the database payload names
  as mva identifiers.
* BtagToWBosonVariables adapted to work with the new ROE.
* All release validation and performance evaluation scripts added to ``$BELLE2_RELEASE_DIR/analysis/release-validation/CPVTools``.
* The flavor tagger creates and adds default aliases into the collection list ``flavor_tagging``.

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

* Added IP tube constraint to KFit.

* The parameter confidenceLevel of the :b2:mod:`ParticleVertexFitter` now always
  rejects the particle candidates with a p-value lower than the specified one.
  Specifically, setting confidenceLevel to 0 does not reject candidates with
  p-value equal to 0 anymore. Thus, the meaning of this parameter is now
  the same as for the :b2:mod:`TreeFitter`.

FEI
+++

* Removed the backward compatibility layer (``pid_renaming_oktober_2017``). 
  Only FEI trainings from release-02 are supported. 
  Please update to ``FEIv4_2018_MC9_release_02_00_01`` or newer.

Variables
+++++++++

.. warning:: we overhauled the helicity variables and added new ones to replace the ``NtupleHelicityTool``.
   We renamed ``cosHelicityAngle`` to :b2:var:`cosHelicityAngleMomentum`,
   ``cosHelicityAnglePi0Dalitz`` to :b2:var:`cosHelicityAngleMomentumPi0Dalitz`, and
   ``cosHelicityAngleIfCMSIsTheMother`` to :b2:var:`cosHelicityAngleBeamMomentum`.
   We added the variables :b2:var:`cosHelicityAngle` and :b2:var:`cosAcoplanarityAngle`
   defining them as the PDG 2018, p. 722.

* The function to create variable aliases for particles selected from a decay
  string has been fixed and extended to allow better customization (:issue:`BII-4437`)

  .. seealso:: `variables.utils.create_aliases_for_selected()`

* Added a variable that returns the distance between a KLMCluster and its associated Track :b2:var:`klmClusterTrackDistance`

* Access to tag vertexing quality indicators for resolution function study, :b2:var:`TagVNDF`, :b2:var:`TagVChi2`, and :b2:var:`TagVChi2IP`.

* Statistically correct combination of p-values :b2:var:`pValueCombination`

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`clusterHasFailedTiming` to check if
  the ECL cluster's timing fit failed.

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`clusterHasFailedErrorTiming` to
  check if the calculation of the ECL cluster's error on the timing failed.

* The chi2 and ndf from KFit vertices are stored as extraInfo for debugging.

* Added :b2:var:`trackFitHypothesisPDG` which returns the PDG code of the successful track fit hypothesis 
  that was used to create this particle (that might be different from the PDG code of the particle list)

* Added variables for 2D Armenteros-Podolanski plot, :b2:var:`ArmenterosLongitudinalMomentumAsymmetry`, 
  :b2:var:`ArmenterosDaughter1Qt`, and :b2:var:`ArmenterosDaughter2Qt`

* Fall-back value changed from zero to NaN for several track variables.

* Added :b2:var:`sourceObjectIsInList` which checks whether there are particles from the same underlying track or cluster in a given particle list. 
  Similar to :b2:var:`isInList` but a tighter check.

* Added :b2:var:`isCloneOfSignalSide` and :b2:var:`hasAncestorFromSignalSide`  variables to monitor the clone particle
  contamination in ROE. These variables use generator information.

* The variables for the fast reco HLT trigger stage have been removed,
  as we are currently not planning to have it in the early data taking.

* The event-based variable ``KLMEnergy`` is removed. It is completely meaningless (:issue:`BII-5002`).

* The variables ( :b2:var:`dx`, :b2:var:`dy`, :b2:var:`dz`, :b2:var:`dr`, :b2:var:`dphi`, :b2:var:`dcosTheta` ) are now with respect to the interaction point (as documented). 
  This now makes them different with respect to the cartesian position ( :b2:var:`x`, :b2:var:`y`, :b2:var:`z` ) with respect to the origin..
  This is similarly true for ( :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPX`, :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPY`, :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPZ` )  versus ( :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexX`, :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexY` and :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexZ` ).

* Added the meta variable :b2:var:`eclClusterSpecialTrackMatched` to check if
  any track related to an ECL cluster satisfies certain criteria. It can be used
  to apply an individual track-cluster matching.

* Added missing error variables :b2:var:`DeltaZErr` and :b2:var:`DeltaBoostErr`. 
  Fixed bug in TagV error functions.

* Replaced :b2:var:`pValue` (tracking variable) with :b2:var:`chiProb` (vertexing variable) 
  in the collection of vertexing variables.

* Replaced :b2:var:`pValue` (always the track-fit pvalue) with :b2:var:`chiProb` (context-dependent :math:`\chi^2` probability variable) in the vertexing variable collection.
 

* Added the meta variables :b2:var:`averageValueInList` and
  :b2:var:`medianValueInList` which calculate the arithmetic mean and median of
  a given variable in a given particle list.

* Removed ``nECLClusters`` (:issue:`BII-4476`).
  The number of ``ECLClusters`` is not a good measure for anything except the age of the input mdst file.
  Recent changes to the handling of ECLClusters and their hypotheses have changed this (already arbitrary) 
  number to another (equally arbitrary but different) number.

  .. hint::
	For most common use cases, the recommended alternative is the total number of photons
        (unique photon hypothesis clusters) in the event:

	.. code-block:: python

		from variables import variables
		from stdPhotons import stdPhotons
		stdPhotons("cdc", path=mypath) # creates the all and cdc lists
                variables.addAlias("nPhotonsAll", "nParticlesInList(gamma:all)")
                variables.addAlias("nPhotonsCDC", "nParticlesInList(gamma:cdc)")
                variables.addAlias("totalPhotonEECL", "totalEnergyOfParticlesInList(gamma:all)")

* Deprecated ``clusterHypothesis`` following changes to the ECLCluster storage on mdst. 
  Please use :b2:var:`clusterHasNPhotons` and :b2:var:`clusterHasNeutralHadron`.

* Removed ``ClusterHadronIntensity`` and ``clusterUniqueID``.

* Added helix extrapolation from charged tracks.

* Added :b2:var:`clusterMdstIndex` variable to get ECLCluster mdst index for particles that do not originate from ECLCluster.

* Added a convenience :b2:var:`M2`, that returns the invariant mass squared of a given Particle (determined from the particle's 4-momentum vector).

* Added :b2:var:`eclClusterOnlyInvariantMass`, that returns the invariant mass of the particles, computed with cluster information

* Added :b2:var:`grandDaughterDiffOf`,  :b2:var:`grandDaughterDiffOfPhi`, and  :b2:var:`grandDaughterDiffOfClusterPhi`.
  They behave like :b2:var:`daughterDiffOf`, but use grandDaughters' information rather than daughters'.

* Renamed ``ClusterHasPulseShapeDiscrimination`` to :b2:var:`clusterHasPulseShapeDiscrimination`, 
  ``PulseShapeDiscriminationMVA`` to :b2:var:`clusterPulseShapeDiscriminationMVA`, 
  and ``ClusterNumberOfHadronDigits`` to :b2:var`clusterNumberOfHadronDigits`.

* Removed the misleading variable ``McFlavorOfTagSide``.

* Added a variable :b2:var:`mcFlavorOfOtherB` which returns the tag-side flavor by checking the other Upsilon4S
  daughter without using the ROE. This variable is part of the default ``flavor_tagging`` collection.

* The name of the variable ``MCTagBFlavor`` changed to :b2:var:`internalTagVMCFlavor`. 
  It should be used only by experts for debugging.

* Added MC flight information variables, :b2:var:`mcFlightDistance` and :b2:var:`mcFlightTime`


Modules
+++++++

* Added the new module :b2:mod:`AllParticleCombiner` which is also available via the
  function `modularAnalysis.combineAllParticles`. It creates a new Particle as
  the combination of all unique Particles from the passed input ParticleLists.

* The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can load `RestOfEvent` as a particle
  using a new function `modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`.
  This ROE particle can be combined with any other particle or written down
  using usual variables.

  Another option is to load missing momentum as a particle by supplementing
  ``useMissing = True`` argument to the function, mentioned above.

* Fixed a bug in the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` module: When
  ``allowMultiRank=True`` there always at least two candidates with rank of one,
  even if they didn't have the same variable value (:issue:`BII-4460`)

  This affects all users of `modularAnalysis.rankByLowest()` and
  `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest()` if they passed ``allowMultiRank=True``

* Fixed a bug in the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` module: now the
  ``numBest`` parameter works as expected. 

* Removal of the unsupported ECLClusterInfoModule.

* Added `vertex.fitPseudo` function and a pseudo vertex fitting module
  to add a covariance matrix when a vertex fit is not possible. E.g. for :math:`\pi^0` decays.

* Added the new module :b2:mod:`SignalSideVariablesToDaughterExtraInfo`. It adds
  ExtraInfo to a specified particle (typically a daughter on the signal side).
  The corresponding information is calculated in the RestOfEvent so it is
  supposed to be executed only in for_each ROE paths.

* Fixed a bug and extended the functionality of the :b2:mod:`RestOfEventBuilder` module.
  When providing a ParticleList of composite particles as an additional source
  for building the ROE, the composite particles are now decomposed and their
  final state daughters are added to the ROE (unless they are part of the
  signal side or already present in the ROE). Previously, composite particles
  were not decomposed and the first composite particle of the first
  ParticleList of composite particles (and only this one) was always added to
  the ROE.

* The module ``VertexFitUpdateDaughters`` now always updates
  the daughters (as advertised).


Modular Analysis
++++++++++++++++

* A new boolean argument has been added to the function
  `modularAnalysis.buildRestOfEvent`. It is called ``belle_sources`` and should be
  switched to True (default is False) if you are analyzing converted Belle MC or
  data. It triggers the ROE to be constructed from all tracks and from Belle's
  specific gamma:mdst list.

* Added signal region function `modularAnalysis.signalRegion`. By default,
  this function enables a new variable ``isSignalRegion`` and excludes the
  defined area when processing is done on data.

Standard Particle Lists
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* Updated V0 lists. The standard list became the merged list, a combined list of particles
  coming from V0 objects merged with a list of particles combined using the analysis 
  :b2:mod:`ParticleCombiner` module.

  `stdV0s.stdKshorts` returns a Ks list called ``K_S0:merged``
  `stdV0s.stdLambdas` returns a Lambda list called ``Lambda0:merged``

  mergedKshorts() and mergedLambdas() are now deprecated, and return the standard lists.
  
* The definition of the standard V0 lists slightly changed. 
  For Lambdas, the modularAnalysis.markDuplicate() function is now used to detect duplicates
  among the same list (V0 and ReconstructDecay), rather than between different lists.
  For Ks, the modularAnalysis.markDuplicate() function is no longer used.

* Updated V0 lists by making them explicitly call the appropriate vertex fit.

* Fixed a bug in the merged Lambda list, which used an incorrect mass window.

* Fix the `stdKlongs.stdKlongs` lists.

* Updated charged standard PID cut values to reflect the correct efficiencies.
  This recovers the efficiency loss reported in :issue:`BIIDP-1065`.

Tutorials
+++++++++

* Fix B2A202 to load Klongs as advertised.
* Fix B2A801 to use JPsiKs as signal channel and to show how to run on Belle data/MC. Central database global tag updated.
