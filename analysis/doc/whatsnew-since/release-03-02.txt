Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

* Added a variable that returns the distance between a KLMCluster and its associated Track :b2:var:`klmClusterTrackDistance`

* Access to tag vertexing quality indicators for resolution function study, :b2:var:`TagVNDF`, :b2:var:`TagVChi2`, and :b2:var:`TagVChi2IP`.

* Statistically correct combination of p-values :b2:var:`pValueCombination`

* chi2 and ndf from KFit vertices stored as extraInfo
Modules
+++++++

* Added the new module AllParticleCombiner which is also available via the
  function `modularAnalysis.combineAllParticles`. It creates a new Particle as
  the combination of all unique Particles from the passed input ParticleLists.
