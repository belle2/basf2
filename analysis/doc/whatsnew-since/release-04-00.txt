Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Renamed some `RestOfEvent` variables for consistency accross the `VariableManager`.
   Variables starting ``WE_XXX``, ``ROE_XXX``, and ``Rec_XXX`` are now ``weXXX``, ``roeXXX``, and ``recXXX``.
   For example ``ROE_deltae`` is now :b2:var:`roeDeltae`.

 * Removed ``clusterCRID`` which duplicates :b2:var:`clusterConnectedRegionID`.
 * Fixed ``goodBelleLambda`` and now it returns ``extraInfo(goodLambda)`` on Belle data.
 * Fixed :b2:var:`eclClusterEoP` for particles with Bremsstrahlung correction by adding the energy of the added photon(s)

.. note::
        All variables will return a quietNaN instead of -999 or other out-of-the-sky numbers in case of errors

Modules
+++++++

 * When merging ParticleLists using the :b2:mod:`ParticleListManipulator`
   (`modularAnalysis.copyLists`) duplicates (not multiple candidates) are removed
   on a first-come, first-served basis, i.e. the order of the input particles
   matters. Now, the new parameter ``variable`` can be provided to determine
   which duplicate should be preferred. The logic is the same as for the
   :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelector`.
 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
   cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` bugfix in mass constraint: chi2 correctly calculated now.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` change of initialisation values increases performance in all fits with tracks.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` max iterations set to 100, increases efficiency slightly in many cases.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` fixed a bug in life time calculation. A constant in the jacobian was missing. As a result propagated error was slightly overestimated.
 * Fix to nested RestOfEvent objects (see :issue:`BII-5649`)
 * Removed module ``CreateBsigFromFullRecoBtag``
 * In BtubeCreator module, functionality to associate Btube to user's chosen B is added.
 * In `ChargedPidMVAModule` module, remove handling of particle list modified by the deprecated `FSRCorrection` module.
 * In `ChargedPidMVAModule` module, apply MVA category cuts retrieved from the DB payload.

Conditions DB
+++++++++++++

 * In `ChargedPidMVAWeights` payload class, added MVA category cut strings in basf2-compliant format.
