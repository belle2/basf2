Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Modules
+++++++

* When merging ParticleLists using the :b2:mod:`ParticleListManipulator`
  (`modularAnalysis.copyLists`) duplicates (not multiple candidates) are removed
  on a first-come, first-served basis, i.e. the order of the input particles
  matters. Now, the new parameter ``variable`` can be provided to determine
  which duplicate should be preferred. The logic is the same as for the
  :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelector`.

* The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
  cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
   cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` bugfix in mass constraint: chi2 correctly calculated now.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` change of initialisation values increases performance in all fits with tracks.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` max iterations set to 100, increases efficiency slightly in many cases.
