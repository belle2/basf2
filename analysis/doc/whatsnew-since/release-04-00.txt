Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Modules
+++++++

* When merging ParticleLists using the :b2:mod:`ParticleListManipulator`
  (`modularAnalysis.copyLists`) duplicates (not multiple candidates) are removed
  on a first-come, first-served basis, i.e. the order of the input particles
  matters. Now, the new parameter ``variable`` can be provided to determine
  which duplicate should be preferred. The logic is the same as for the
  :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelector`.

* The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
  cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
