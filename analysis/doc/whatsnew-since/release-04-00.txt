Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Renamed some `RestOfEvent` variables for consistency accross the `VariableManager`.
   Variables starting ``WE_XXX``, ``ROE_XXX``, and ``Rec_XXX`` are now ``weXXX``, ``roeXXX``, and ``recXXX``.
   For example ``ROE_deltae`` is now :b2:var:`roeDeltae`.

 * Removed ``clusterCRID`` which duplicates :b2:var:`clusterConnectedRegionID`.

 * Modified :b2:var:`daughterAngleInBetween` to accept generalized variable indeces instead of simple indeces. A 
   generalized index is a column-separated string of daughter indexes belonging to different generations, 
   starting from the root particle. For example, ``0:2:1`` indicates the second daughter (0) of the third daughter
   (2) of the first daughter (0) of the particle. Of course, conventional indexes are still working as expected:
   ``1`` still indicates the second daughter of the particle.

 * Added :b2:var:`daughterCombination`, that returns a variable calculated on the sum
   of an arbitrary number of daughters. Generalized indeces are supported. This variable is mostly intended
   to calculate the invariant mass or the recoil mass of any set of particles belonging to a decay tree.

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
   cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` bugfix in mass constraint: chi2 correctly calculated now.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` change of initialisation values increases performance in all fits with tracks.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` max iterations set to 100, increases efficiency slightly in many cases.
 * Fix to nested RestOfEvent objects (see :issue:`BII-5649`)
 * Removed module ``CreateBsigFromFullRecoBtag``

Variables
+++++++++

 * Fixed ``goodBelleLambda`` and now it returns ``extraInfo(goodLambda)`` on Belle data.
