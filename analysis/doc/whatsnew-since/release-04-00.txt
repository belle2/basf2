Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Allow use of meta variables in creation of aliases by replacing non
   alphanumeric characters with underscores in the alias name

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
   cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` bugfix in mass constraint: chi2 correctly calculated now.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` change of initialisation values increases performance in all fits with tracks.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` max iterations set to 100, increases efficiency slightly in many cases.
