Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Renamed some `RestOfEvent` variables for consistency accross the `VariableManager`.
   Variables starting ``WE_XXX``, ``ROE_XXX``, and ``Rec_XXX`` are now ``weXXX``, ``roeXXX``, and ``recXXX``.
   For example ``ROE_deltae`` is now :b2:var:`roeDeltae`.

 * Removed ``clusterCRID`` which duplicates :b2:var:`clusterConnectedRegionID`.
 * Fixed ``goodBelleLambda`` and now it returns ``extraInfo(goodLambda)`` on Belle data.
 * Fixed :b2:var:`eclClusterEoP` for particles with Bremsstrahlung correction by adding the energy of the added photon(s)

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
   cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` bugfix in mass constraint: chi2 correctly calculated now.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` change of initialisation values increases performance in all fits with tracks.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` max iterations set to 100, increases efficiency slightly in many cases.
 * Fix to nested RestOfEvent objects (see :issue:`BII-5649`)
 * Removed module ``CreateBsigFromFullRecoBtag``
