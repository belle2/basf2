Changes in the analysis package since release-04-00
---------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
 * Now vertex variables ``dr, dx, dy, dz, dphi, dcosTheta...`` take into account the nontrivial
   transformation of track parameters relative to IP when used for tracks.
   `dr` did not center at zero before and now it does.
 * Added :b2:var:`isDescendantOfList` and :b2:var:`isMCDescendantOfList` meta variables that allow to check whether the
   particle is the descendant of the list (or if it is matched to the descendant of the list) at any generation.
   The variables have recursive search inside, they extend :b2:var:`isDaughterOfList` and :b2:var:`isGrandDaughterOfList`.
 * Added :b2:var:`mcParticleIsInMCList` which checks the underlying MC particles (either matched or generator level).
 * Fixed bug and renamed ``mcFlavorOfOtherB0`` variable to :b2:var:`mcFlavorOfOtherB`, which accepts now neutral and charged B
   candidates.
 * Removed ``clusterCRID`` which duplicates :b2:var:`clusterConnectedRegionID`.
 * Fixed ``goodBelleLambda`` and now it returns ``extraInfo(goodLambda)`` on Belle data.
 * Allow use of meta variables in creation of aliases by replacing non
   alphanumeric characters with underscores in the alias name
 * Modified :b2:var:`daughterAngle` to accept generalized variable indices instead of simple indices. A
   generalized index is a column-separated string of daughter indexes belonging to different generations,
   starting from the root particle. For example, ``0:2:1`` indicates the second daughter (0) of the third daughter
   (2) of the first daughter (0) of the particle. Of course, conventional indexes are still working as expected:
   ``1`` still indicates the second daughter of the particle.
 * Added :b2:var:`daughterCombination`, that returns a variable calculated on the sum
   of an arbitrary number of daughters. Generalized indexes are supported. This variable is mostly intended
   to calculate the invariant mass or the recoil mass of any set of particles belonging to a decay tree.
 * Fixed :b2:var:`isSignal`, which always accepted ``c_MissingResonance`` and ``c_MissFSR``/``c_MissPHOTOS`` even if one used
   ``=direct=>``, ``=norad=>``, or ``=exact=>``.
   Now it correctly respects the decay string grammar. The other isSignal* variables, such as :b2:var:`isSignalAcceptMissing`, are
   also fixed.
 * Added :b2:var:`useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis`, that returns a variable re-calculated using alternative mass assumptions for
   the particle's daughters.
 * Restructured the ``mc_flight_info`` collection by removing the non-sense
   error variables and replacing ``mc_flightTime`` and ``mc_flightDistance``,
   which were aliases created using `matchedMC`, with the dedicated variables
   `mcFlightTime` and `mcFlightDistance`, respectively.
 * Removed ``output_variable`` option in the :ref:`DeepFlavorTagger` and introduced a standard variable ``DNN_qrCombined`` for the
   output.
   The new variable returns the flavor times the dilution factor as the category-based :ref:`FlavorTagger` output variables
   ``FBDT_qrCombined`` and ``FANN_qrCombined`` do.
   Now we can evaluate the output of both taggers in the same way.
 * Bug fix to guard against range exceptions in :b2:var:`KSFWVariables` (see :issue:`BII-6138`).

Modules
+++++++

 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` fixed a bug in life time calculation. A constant in the jacobian was missing. As a result the
   propagated error was slightly overestimated.
 * Fix to nested RestOfEvent objects (see :issue:`BII-5649`)
 * Fixed bugs in :b2:mod:`MCDecayFinder` and `findMCDecay`.
   Inefficiency and large background when one used ``=direct=>`` or sub-decay such as ``D*+ -> [D0 -> pi+ pi- pi0] pi+`` are fixed.
   But still the module has some bugs if one uses K_S0.

Conditions DB
+++++++++++++

 * In ``ChargedPidMVAWeights`` payload class, added MVA category cut strings in basf2-compliant format.

Full Event Interpretation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Addition of hadronic FEI channels involving baryons. This includes the addition to default channels the following particles: p,
   Lambda_c+, Sigma+ and Lambda0. Baryonic modes must be switched on when calling particles = fei.get_default_channels(baryonic =
   True) using a flag (baryonic = True).
