Changes in the analysis package since release-04-02
---------------------------------------------------

 .. warning:: Global includes like ``from basf2 import *`` are almost completely removed from the analysis package.

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

 .. warning:: The convenience function for the :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` module has
    been renamed from ``vertexTree`` to :func:`vertex.treeFit`.

 .. warning:: The KFit convenience functions have been merged to the new
    function :func:`vertex.kFit`. One of its input arguments is ``fit_type``,
    which specifies whether you want to perform a mass fit
    (``fit_type=mass``), a vertex fit (``fit_type=vertex``), a
    mass-constrained vertex fit (``fit_type=massvertex``), or a vertex fit
    with the mother constrained to the beam four-momentum
    (``fit_type=fourC``).

 * Added ``smearing`` parameter to `vertex.kFit`.
   When you perform a vertex fit with an IP tube constraint (``fit_type=vertex`` and ``constraint=iptube``), the IP profile is
   smeared by the given value.
   The IP tube is defined by a neutral track pointing towards the boost direction starting from the smeared IP profile.
   Setting ``smearing=0`` gives the original ``iptube`` option, which is an elongated ellipsoid in boost direction.

 * Fixed TreeFitter bias on V0s by propagating the correct TrackFitResult from V0 daughters (see :issue:`BII-6336`).

 * Added ``FeedthroughParticle`` and ``InternalTrack`` to `vertex.treeFit`.
   This now provides compatibility of TreeFitter with the bremsstrahlung recovery modules.
   In principle, TreeFitter can now be used for decays for which Bremsstrahlung correction has been applied. However, there are
   massive performance issues. Do not blindly use TreeFit but cross-check your results with KFit. Further improvements are planned.

Standard Particle Lists
+++++++++++++++++++++++

 * The list label ``"all"`` is now forbidden from use with cuts. This can introduce some very subtle bugs in user scripts.
   The following code will no longer work:

   .. code-block:: python

	fillParticleList("gamma:all", "clusterE > 0.02", path=mypath)

   Instead you should replace it with a meaningful name of your choice. For example:

   .. code-block:: python

	fillParticleList("gamma:myMinimumThresholdList", "clusterE > 0.02", path=mypath)


 * Added stdHyperons.py, this analysis script reconstructs the standard hyperons Xi-, Xi0, and Omega-.
   	 
   * New functions include `stdXi`, `stdXi0`, `stdOmega`, `goodXi`, `goodXi0`, and `goodOmega`
   * All documentation for this optimization and usage can be found at `BELLE2-NOTE-PH-2019-011 <https://docs.belle2.org/record/1337/files/BELLE2-NOTE-PH-2019-011.pdf>`_

 * The default vertex fitter for the V0 lists `stdKshorts` and `stdLambdas` has been changed from ``Rave`` to ``TreeFit``.
   However, a new option called ``fitter`` has been added that allows to change the vertex fitter back to `raveFit` or to `kFit`.
   This change is motivated by a much faster execution time (see :issue:`BII-5699`) and a compatible performance as summarized
   `here <https://indico.belle2.org/event/1684/contributions/9245/attachments/4576/7096/V0VertexFitting_workshopSummary.pdf>`_.
 * Added a new standard list `stdCharged.stdMostLikely` which creates 5 mutually-exclusive lists of track-based particles under
   their most likely hypothesis.
 * Moved the KlId check from :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` to `stdKlongs`. This modification does not change the definition of the
   ``K_L0:all`` list and, in general, of the user-defined :math:`K_{L}^0` lists.
 * Removed the functions ``mergedKshorts`` and ``mergedLambdas``, which returned the standard V0 lists anyway.
 * Removed the deprecated pi0 lists ``pi0:loose`` and ``pi0:veryloose``
 * stdPi0s and stdPhotons updated to match Jan2020 recommendations.  Naming scheme updated to indicate date of optimization.

Variables
+++++++++

  .. note:: All variables will return a quietNaN instead of -999 or other out-of-the-sky numbers in case of errors.
     To study the failures use the meta variable `ifNANgiveX`, which replaces nan with a value of your choice.

 .. warning:: The variables :b2:var:`decayAngle`, :b2:var:`daughterAngle` and :b2:var:`pointingAngle` now return an angle instead of a cosine.

 * Renamed ``mcDX``, ``mcDY``, ``mcDZ``, and ``mcDRho`` to :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPX`, :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPY`,
   :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPZ`, and :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPRho`.
 * Renamed ``mdstSource`` to :b2:var:`uniqueParticleIdentifier`.
 * Renamed ``MCDeltaT`` to :b2:var:`mcDeltaT`
 * Renamed ``mcX``, ``mcY``, ``mcZ``, and ``mcRho`` to :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexX`, :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexY`,
   :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexZ`, and :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexRho`.
 * Renamed ``mcProdVertexX``, ``mcProdVertexY``, and ``mcProdVertexZ`` to :b2:var:`mcProductionVertexX`,
   :b2:var:`mcProductionVertexY`, and :b2:var:`mcProductionVertexZ`.
 * Renamed ``mcProdVertexDX``, ``mcProdVertexDY``, and ``mcProdVertexDZ`` to :b2:var:`mcProductionVertexFromIPX`,
   :b2:var:`mcProductionVertexFromIPY`, and :b2:var:`mcProductionVertexFromIPZ`.
 * Renamed ``mcDistance`` to :b2:var:`mcDecayVertexFromIPDistance`.
 * Added :b2:var:`varForFirstMCAncestorOfType` variable that returns requested variable of the first gen-level
   ancestor of the given type.
 * Now vertex variables ``dr, dx, dy, dz, dphi, dcosTheta...`` take into account the nontrivial
   transformation of track parameters relative to IP when used for tracks.
   `dr` did not center at zero before and now it does.
 * Added :b2:var:`isDescendantOfList` and :b2:var:`isMCDescendantOfList` meta variables that allow to check whether the
   particle is the descendant of the list (or if it is matched to the descendant of the list) at any generation.
   The variables have recursive search inside, they extend :b2:var:`isDaughterOfList` and :b2:var:`isGrandDaughterOfList`.
 * Renamed some `RestOfEvent` variables for consistency across the `VariableManager`.
   Variables starting ``WE_XXX``, ``ROE_XXX``, and ``Rec_XXX`` are now ``weXXX``, ``roeXXX``, and ``recXXX``.
   For example ``ROE_deltae`` is now :b2:var:`roeDeltae`.
 * Fixed calculation of :b2:var:`cosHelicityAngleMomentum` for decays with bremscorrected electrons
 * Fixed :b2:var:`clusterEoP` for particles with Bremsstrahlung correction by adding the energy of the added photon(s)
 * Added :b2:var:`isSignalAcceptBremsPhotons` to ignore any reconstructed brems photons.

  .. note:: This is not the generator-level match (see :issue:`BII-5741`) but simply ignores photons added by the :b2:mod:`BremsFinder`.

 * Added :b2:var:`useTagSideRecoilRestFrame`, which allows variables to be calculated in the rest frame
   recoiling against the tag side B meson. This variable is intended to be used on Upsilon(4S) particle lists
   only. The variable gives access to the signal B rest frame in semi-leptonic decays, where the four momentum
   of the signal B can not be entirely reconstructed due to the presence of neutrinos in the decay.
 * Added new variables for fully-inclusive analysis: :b2:var:`nDaughterPhotons`, :b2:var:`nDaughterCharged` etc., which allow to
   count specific daughters easily, and :b2:var:`daughterAverageOf`, which is similar to the :b2:var:`daughterSumOf`, but outputs
   the mean value of a variable.
 * Fixed :b2:var:`goodBelleKshort`, now it returns ``extraInfo(goodKs)`` if the variable exists.
 * Added two new variables :b2:var:`pidMostLikelyPDG` which is the PDG code of the most likely hypothesis for this track, and
   :b2:var:`pidIsMostLikely` which returns true if the particle *is* under its most likely hypothesis.
 * Added PID prior hypothesis to the :b2:var:`pidMostLikelyPDG` and the :b2:var:`pidIsMostLikely` variables.
 * Added several variables that related to the quality of the tag B vertex fit and the tracks used in that fit:
   :b2:var:`TagVNFitTracks`, :b2:var:`TagVDistanceToConstraint`, :b2:var:`TagVDistanceToConstraintErr`,
   :b2:var:`TagTrackMomentumX`, :b2:var:`TagTrackMomentumX`, :b2:var:`TagTrackMomentumZ`,
   :b2:var:`TagTrackRaveWeight`, :b2:var:`TagTrackDistanceToConstraint`,
   :b2:var:`TagTrackDistanceToConstraintErr`, :b2:var:`TagTrackDistanceToTagV`, :b2:var:`TagTrackDistanceToTagVErr`,
   :b2:var:`TagTrackTrueDistanceToTagV`. Meta-variables can be used to compute the average, weighted average, min or max
   of these variables, e.g. by doing ``TagTrackAverage(TagTrackTrueDistanceToTagV)`` 
 * Added ``mcDeltaL`` describing the true distance between Sig and Tag
   vertices in the Y(4S) boost direction
 * Added ``mcDeltaTapprox`` to get :b2:var:`mcDeltaT` in the kinematic
   approximation, i.e. based on ``mcDeltaL`` variable
 * Added :b2:var:`pidChargedBDTScore` and :b2:var:`pidPairChargedBDTScore` for global and binary BDT-based charged particle
   identification, respectively. Require booking the `ChargedPidMVAMulticlass` (`ChargedPidMVA`) module in the path.
 * Bug fix for the `isCloneTrack` variable. Antiparticles have been falsely classified which is now fixed (see :issue:`BII-5973`)
 * Added :b2:var:`isChargedBEvent` and :b2:var:`isUnmixedBEvent` variables
 * The variables `daughterAngle` and ``daughterAngleInBetween`` have been merged using the name of the former but the extended
   functionality of the latter.
 * Removed the variable ``SigMBF``, which was supposed to return the mass significance before a vertex fit but was only a
   pseudo-significance.

 .. hint:: It is recommended to use `variablesToExtraInfo` prior to a vertex fit to access pre-fit values,
           not only for mass significances but also for vertex positions, etc.

 * Fixed truth kinematic variables (`mcPX`, `mcPY`, ...) to respect the current reference frame, so that they can be accessed not
   only in the lab frame but for example as well in the CMS frame using `useCMSFrame`.
 * Extended functionality of recoil kinematics variables (`pxRecoil`, `pyRecoil`, ...) to be usable with any requested frame.
 * Added :b2:var:`isFromV0` to identify particles that come from tracking-level V0's (as opposed to those created at
   analysis-level using `modularAnalysis.reconstructDecay`).
 * Removed ``isExtendedSignal`` whose exact behavior is mirrored by `isSignalAcceptWrongFSPs`.
 * Added the new variable collection ``event_kinematics`` which contains all variables available after running the
   `EventKinematics` module.
 * Added :b2:var:`unmask`, which unmasks certain indicated bits in a variable (set certain bits in a variable to zero).
 * Added a new variable util ``create_isSignal_alias`` which creates customized :b2:var:`isSignal`, accepting certain match errors.
 * Removed the previously deprecated variable ``clusterHypothesis``.
 * Added :b2:var:`firstCDCLayer`, returns the ID of the CDC layer closest to the IP with a hit attributed to the particles track 
 * Added the new variable collection ``cluster_average``. It contains the cluster variables that can only be executed for
   particles with daughters, currently :b2:var:`maxWeightedDistanceFromAverageECLTime` and :b2:var:`weightedAverageECLTime`.
 * Added a variable for TDCPV resolution study :b2:var:`DeltaTRes` and legacy Belle :b2:var:`DeltaTBelle`.
 * Added :b2:var:`genIPX`, :b2:var:`genIPY`, and :b2:var:`genIPZ`; the generator-level IP.
 * Clarified the documentation of the **measured** interaction point variables (:b2:var:`IPX` ff).

Modules
+++++++

 * When merging ParticleLists using the :b2:mod:`ParticleListManipulator` (`modularAnalysis.copyLists`) duplicates (not
   multiple candidates) are removed on a first-come, first-served basis, i.e. the order of the input particles matters.
   Now, the new parameter ``variable`` can be provided to determine which duplicate should be preferred. The logic is the
   same as for the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` module. Furthermore, duplicates, which differ only by the order of
   their daughter particles, are now identified.
 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` can create neutron particle lists now. ECL
   cluster with the hadron hypothesis as well as KLM cluster are used as source.
 * Tweaks to the :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` for how it creates particles from V0s, it now preserves the link to the mdst object.
   These changes are all under-the-hood and require no actions by users.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` bugfix in mass constraint: chi2 correctly calculated now.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` change of initialisation values increases performance in all fits with tracks.
 * In :b2:mod:`TreeFitter` max iterations set to 100, increases efficiency slightly in many cases.
 * Removed module ``CreateBsigFromFullRecoBtag``
 * In BtubeCreator module, functionality to associate Btube to user's chosen B is added.
 * Removed module ``FSRCorrection`` in favour of `BremsFinder` and `BelleBremRecovery`.
 * In `ChargedPidMVA` module, remove handling of particle list modified by the removed ``FSRCorrection`` module.
 * In `ChargedPidMVA` module, apply MVA category cuts retrieved from the DB payload.
 * Added `ChargedPidMVAMulticlass` module to allow performing global PID (one-vs-rest), using an MVA trained in multi-class mode.
 * Added a :b2:mod:`BremsFinder` to unpack the bremsstrahlung relations provided by tracking.

  .. hint:: This tool is the recommended way to correct for bremsstrahlung photons in Belle II analyses.

 * Modified `writePi0EtaVeto` function and added `oldwritePi0EtaVeto` function. The weight files used in release-03 were not
   available in release-04.
   The latter uses old weight files optimized with MC9, while new weight files, which are optimized with MC12, are used in
   `writePi0EtaVeto`
 * Enabled to select daughters which will be used to perform fitting with KFit. One can use the selector ``^`` to select daughters.
 * KFit can be used to fit vertices of fully-inclusive particles, for which it ignores the daughters without defined p-value. 
 * :b2:mod:`RestOfEventBuilder`, :b2:mod:`EventKinematics` and :b2:mod:`EventShapeCalculator` modules can use most likely charged
   particle hypothesis according to PID information.
 * Added the :b2:mod:`ParticleCombinerFromMC` module and the `reconstructMCDecay` to find and create ``ParticleList`` from a given
   :ref:`DecayString`.
   They can be used instead of the :b2:mod:`MCDecayFinder` and `findMCDecay` which are not fully tested and maintained.
 * In :b2:mod:`TagVertex` added Btube as a possible constraint for the tag B vertex fit. The ``useFitAlgorithm`` parameter in the
   module is replaced by ``constraintType`` (which can be set to ``tube``) and ``trackFindingType``. All computations done in the
   module are now using double precision.
   The module is also updated to allow for the computations of new variables related to the tracks used in the tag vertex fit.
 * Added a :b2:mod:`InclusiveDstarReconstruction` to inclusively reconstruct D* mesons by estimating the four vector using slow
   pions.
 * In the `TagV` function, added the possibility to use KFit instead of Rave to perform the tag vertex fit.
 * Both flavor taggers support ROE masks. Added new maskName argument.
 * Added new :ref:`DecayString` grammar for ``c_AddedRecoBremsPhoton``, ``c_DecayInFlight``, and ``c_MisID``. If one uses
   ``?addbrems`` in own DecayString, ``c_AddedRecoBremsPhoton`` is ignored, thus :b2:var:`isSignal` works as
   :b2:var:`isSignalAcceptBremsPhotons`.
   One can add ``(decay)`` and/or ``(misID)`` to the beginning of the particle name to accept ``c_DecayInFlight`` and/or
   ``c_MisID``.
   The following is an example, :code:`'reconstructDecay('D0:sig -> (misID)K-:loose (decay)pi+:loose', '', path=mypath)'`

 * Modified `modularAnalysis.matchMCTruth` to work always recursively. Once one calls `modularAnalysis.matchMCTruth` for a
   particle, the MC Matching is done for not only the particle but also all daughters of the particle correctly.
   This modification does not change the MC Matching of the particle for which `modularAnalysis.matchMCTruth` is called.
 * Added feature to add multiple TTrees to the same output file via the :b2:mod:`VariablesToEventBasedTree` module.
 * Rest Of Event can be created using MCParticles using `modularAnalysis.buildRestOfEventFromMC`
 * Removed ``-->``, ``=>``, and ``==>`` from the list of allowed arrow types for the `DecayString`.
 * In :b2:mod:`TagVertex` module, added the possibility to use the truth information from the tag particles in the vertex fit. The
   option :code:`useTruthInFit = True` switches that on.
 * In :b2:mod:`TagVertex` module, implemented an internal change: tag particles are loaded as ``Particle`` object from the ``ROE``
   and not anymore as ``TrackFitResult``. This should have no effect to users.
 * Added a warning to the `ParticleCombiner` module for decay strings violating electric charge conservation which can be turned
   off by setting ``allowChargeViolation=True``.
 * In :b2:mod:`TagVertex` module, added the possibility to perform vertex fit with the tag particle tracks rolled back to their primary vertex points. The
   option :code:`useRollBack = True` switches that on.
 * Added an argument to the `ParticleCombiner` module that allows to deactivate the automatic reconstruction of the
   charge-conjugated mode. In `reconstructDecay` the option is called ``chargeConjugation``, which is ``True`` by default.
 * The MC matching with the :ref:`DecayString` properly works in hierarchical decay. For example,

   .. code-block:: python

        from modularAnalysis import reconstructDecay, matchMCTruth
        reconstructDecay('B0:signal      -> mu+ mu- ... ?gamma',   '', path=mypath)
        reconstructDecay('B0:generic     -> D*-:Dpi pi+:all',      '', path=mypath)
        reconstructDecay('Upsilon(4S):BB -> B0:generic B0:signal', '', path=mypath)
        matchMCTruth('Upsilon(4S)', path=mypath)

   In the above case, missing daughters (massive FSP and gamma) of ``B0:signal`` are accepted for not only ``B0:signal`` but also ``Upsilon(4S)``, so that `isSignal` can be 1.
   Another example,

   .. code-block:: python

        reconstructDecay('D-:pipi0 -> pi-:all pi0:all',      '', path=mypath)
	reconstructDecay('B0:Dpi   -> D-:pipi0 pi+:all ...', '', path=mypath)
        matchMCTruth('B0:Dpi', path=mypath)

   In this case, one wants to accept missing massive daughters in ``B0:Dpi`` decay but not in ``D-:pipi0`` decay.
   So, if the decay of ``D-:pipi0`` in the MC truth level is ``D- -> pi+ pi- pi- pi0``, `isSignal` of ``D-:pipi0`` and ``B0:Dpi`` will be 0, 
   since there are missing daughters in ``D-:pipi0`` decay. If one wants to accept missing daughters in ``D-:pipi0``, please use the 
   :ref:`DecayString` grammar in the reconstruction of ``D-:pipi0`` or use `isSignalAcceptMissing` variable instead of `isSignal`.

Utilities and core objects
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * A set of functions ``DistanceTools`` has been added to compute distances between (straight) tracks and vertices.
 * Added a relation between Track-based Particles and TrackFitResults.
 * Added a ``getTrackFitResult`` method to Particle.
 * Added a function to retrieve electric charge of a particle based on its pdg code.
 * Added a ``RotationTools.h`` file with few functions related to rotation

Tutorials and Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added a tutorial about creating aliases (``examples/VariableManager/variableAliases.py``)
