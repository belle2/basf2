Changes in the analysis package since release-05-00
---------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Variables :b2:var:`recQ2Bh`, :b2:var:`recMissM2`, :b2:var:`recQ2BhSimple` have been moved to a new variable group ``Specific kinematic variables``,
   and :b2:var:`recQ2Bh` is now using a `diamond frame method <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1442697>`_
 * Variable ``TagVmcLBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVLBoost` and variable ``TagVmcOBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVOBoost`
 * Variable ``mcDeltaL`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcDeltaBoost` as it represents mc-truth version of :b2:var:`DeltaBoost` variable

 * Variables `clusterThetaID` and `clusterPhiID` have both been added as a new variable  
Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`InclusiveDstarReconstruction` creates antiparticle lists correctly now. The module's input changed to a
   :ref:`DecayString` of the form ``D* -> pi`` and MC Matching is applicable (one can use :b2:var:`isSignal`).
 * In `BtubeCreator` module, functionality to apply a cut on the confidence level of the fit of fully reconstructed B to the
   beamspot is added.
 * The MC matching with the :ref:`DecayString` properly works in hierarchical decay. For example, 
.. code-block:: python

        from modularAnalysis import reconstructDecay, matchMCTruth
	reconstructDecay('B0:signal  -> mu+ mu- ... ?gamma', '', path=mypath)
	reconstructDecay('B0:generic -> D*-:Dpi pi+:all', '', path=mypath)
	reconstructDecay('Upsilon(4S):BB -> B0:generic B0:signal', '', path=mypath)
	matchMCTruth('Upsilon(4S)', path=mypath)

   In above case, missing massive FSP and gamma in ``B0:signal`` are accepted for not only ``B0:signal`` but also ``Upsilon(4S)``, so that `isSignal` can be 1.
