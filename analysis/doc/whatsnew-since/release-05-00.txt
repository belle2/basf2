Changes in the analysis package since release-05-00
---------------------------------------------------

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

 * KFit has been extended to be able to handle vertex fits (with and without mass constraint) that involve an eta particle
   reconstructed in ``eta -> gamma gamma``.

Variables
+++++++++

 * Variables :b2:var:`SoftwareTriggerResult`, :b2:var:`SoftwareTriggerResultNonPrescaled` and :b2:var:`SoftwareTriggerPrescaling` now silently return NAN if the trigger is not found.

   .. warning:: this no longer dumps all possible trigger names instead please see ``b2hlt_triggers`` for a list of all possible names.

   .. seealso:: ``b2hlt_triggers print --database online --format list``

 * Variables :b2:var:`recQ2Bh`, :b2:var:`recMissM2`, :b2:var:`recQ2BhSimple` have been moved to a new variable group ``Specific kinematic variables``,
   and :b2:var:`recQ2Bh` is now using a `diamond frame method <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1442697>`_
 * Added the new variable :b2:var:`photonHasOverlap`, which determines whether a particle's cluster is sharing its connected
   region with another cluster. A cut string can be provided to ignore cluster that do not satisfy the specified criteria.
 * Variable ``TagVmcLBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVLBoost` and variable ``TagVmcOBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVOBoost`
 * Variable ``mcDeltaL`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcDeltaBoost` as it represents mc-truth version of :b2:var:`DeltaBoost` variable
 * Variables `clusterThetaID` and `clusterPhiID` have both been added as a new variable
 * Event-based variables from ``cluster`` collection have been moved into a new ``event_level_cluster`` collection, 
   collections of ROE and recoil variables have been expanded
 * Added the variable :b2:var:`binaryPID`, which takes two PID codes as arguments and calculates the binary PID between them. A few
   binary PID variables have been added to the PID variable collection.

   .. hint:: The hadron PID group recommends to try out the binary PID in analyses and compare the performance with the global PID.

 * Added new generated event kinematics variables :b2:var:`genMissingMass2OfEvent`,  :b2:var:`genMissingEnergyOfEventCMS`, 
   :b2:var:`genMissingMomentumOfEventCMS`, :b2:var:`genTotalPhotonsEnergyOfEvent`, :b2:var:`genVisibleEnergyOfEventCMS` 
   and a corresponding collection ``mc_event_kinematics``.
 * Fixed the variable :b2:var:`isDescendantOfList`, which did not work if the ParticleLoader was used to fill a ParticleList with
   descendants of an existing list or exclude them.

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`InclusiveDstarReconstruction` creates antiparticle lists correctly now. The module's input changed to a
   :ref:`DecayString` of the form ``D* -> pi`` and MC Matching is applicable (one can use :b2:var:`isSignal`).
 * In `BtubeCreator` module, functionality to apply a cut on the confidence level of the fit of fully reconstructed B to the
   beamspot is added.
 * Added the new wrapper function `applyRandomCandidateSelection`, which uses the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` module to
   reduce the number of candidates in the input particle list to one candidate per event based on a random value.
 * The ``EventKinematics`` module can now compute event kinematics using generated particles as an input.

Full Event Interpretation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added option to reconstruct strange B mesons (at Y(5S)) in 51 decay channels. Can be switched on with the ``strangeB`` flag in `fei.get_default_channels()`.
