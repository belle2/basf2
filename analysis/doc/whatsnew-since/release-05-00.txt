Changes in the analysis package since release-05-00
---------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Variables :b2:var:`recQ2Bh`, :b2:var:`recMissM2`, :b2:var:`recQ2BhSimple` have been moved to a new variable group ``Specific kinematic variables``,
   and :b2:var:`recQ2Bh` is now using a `diamond frame method <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1442697>`_
 * Variable ``TagVmcLBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVLBoost` and variable ``TagVmcOBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVOBoost`
 * Variable ``mcDeltaL`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcDeltaBoost` as it represents mc-truth version of :b2:var:`DeltaBoost` variable
 * Added variables to get track information of V0 daughters from TrackFitResult in V0 objects:
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterNCDCHits`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNSVDHits`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNPXDHits`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNVXDHits`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstSVDLayer`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstPXDLayer`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstCDCLayer`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterLastCDCLayer`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterPValue`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmega`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambda`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0Error`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0Error`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaError`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0Error`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaError`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaPullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaPullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0PullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0PullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaPullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0PullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaPullWithOriginAsPivot`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterTau`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterCov` in a new variable group ``V0Daughter``.
   These variables can also be used for the V0s from reconstructDecay, but the information are taken from the TrackFitResult of daughters.

Modules
+++++++

  * The :b2:mod:`InclusiveDstarReconstruction` creates antiparticle lists correctly now. The module's input changed to a :ref:`DecayString` of the
    form ``D* -> pi`` and MC Matching is applicable (one can use :b2:var:`isSignal`).
 * In `BtubeCreator` module, functionality to apply a cut on the confidence level of the fit of fully reconstructed B to the
   beamspot is added.
