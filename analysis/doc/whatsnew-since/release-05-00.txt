Changes in the analysis package since release-05-00
---------------------------------------------------

Bremsstrahlung correction
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Fixed that the copies of particles to which Bremsstrahlung was applied (whether this resulted in a added photon or
   not) are considered as sources of tracks. This allows to update the daughters in vertex fits that involve
   brems-corrected particles.

Variables
+++++++++

 * Variable ``TagVmcLBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVLBoost` and variable ``TagVmcOBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVOBoost`
 * Variable ``mcDeltaL`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcDeltaBoost` as it represents mc-truth version of :b2:var:`DeltaBoost` variable
 * Added variables to get track information of V0 daughters from TrackFitResult in V0 objects:
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterNCDCHits`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNSVDHits`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNPXDHits`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNVXDHits`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstSVDLayer`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstPXDLayer`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstCDCLayer`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterLastCDCLayer`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterPValue`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmega`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambda`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0Error`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0Error`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaError`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0Error`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaError`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaPullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaPullWithTrueVertexAsPivot`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0PullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0PullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaPullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0PullWithOriginAsPivot`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaPullWithOriginAsPivot`,
   :b2:var:`v0DaughterTau`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterCov` in a new variable group ``V0Daughter``.
   These variables can also be used for the V0s from reconstructDecay, but the information are taken from the TrackFitResult of daughters.
 * Added new generated event kinematics variables :b2:var:`genMissingMass2OfEvent`,  :b2:var:`genMissingEnergyOfEventCMS`,
   :b2:var:`genMissingMomentumOfEventCMS`, :b2:var:`genTotalPhotonsEnergyOfEvent`, :b2:var:`genVisibleEnergyOfEventCMS`
   and a corresponding collection ``mc_event_kinematics``.
 * Fixed the variable :b2:var:`isDescendantOfList`, which did not work if the ParticleLoader was used to fill a ParticleList with
   descendants of an existing list or exclude them.
 * Added new B2BII variables for the first and last hit position in the tracking system :b2:var:`BelleFirstCDCHitX`,
   :b2:var:`BelleLastCDCHitX`, etc. and a new variable collection ``belle_track_hit``.
 * Added new variables :b2:var:`ndf` and :b2:var:`chi2` to return track NDF and Chi2
 * Added new variable :b2:var:`YAngle` containing value of the vertical beam crossing angle (in the y-z plane) in the MC
 * Added the variable `particleSource`, which returns the mdst source, i.e. whether the particle was created from a track, an ECL
   cluster, or a KLM cluster, is a V0 object, an MC particle, or a composite particle.
 * Exclude SVD from definition of standard global and binary PID variables (like ``electronID``, ``pionID`` etc.). This change is
   introduced because physical SVD PDFs are available only for some particle hypotheses, but not for others yet.
 * Added the variable :b2:var:`binaryPID`, which takes two PID codes as arguments and calculates the binary PID between them.

   .. hint:: The hadron PID group recommends to try out the binary PID in analyses and compare the performance with the global PID.


Modules
+++++++

 * Added the new wrapper function `applyRandomCandidateSelection`, which uses the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` module to
   reduce the number of candidates in the input particle list to one candidate per event based on a random value.
 * In :b2:mod:`TagVertex`, all charged particles from the ROE are loaded to be included in the tag vertex fit (and not only those
   with a pion hypothesis)
 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleCombinerFromMC` and the `reconstructMCDecay` function can set decayModeID extraInfo with an argument
   ``dmID``. One can decide whether charge conjugated mode should be reconstructed with new boolean argument ``chargeConjugation``
   (true by default).
 * The special treatment of MCMatching for the tau-decay is fixed. The treatment was working fine in release-04, but it was broken
   in the release-05.
