Variables
+++++++++

 * Variables :b2:var:`recQ2Bh`, :b2:var:`recMissM2`, :b2:var:`recQ2BhSimple` have been moved to a new variable group ``Specific kinematic variables``, 
   and :b2:var:`recQ2Bh` is now using a `diamond frame method <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1442697>`_
 * Added the new variable :b2:var:`photonHasOverlap`, which determines whether a particle's cluster is sharing its connected
   region with another cluster. A cut string can be provided to ignore cluster that do not satisfy the specified criteria.
