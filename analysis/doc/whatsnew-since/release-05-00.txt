Changes in the analysis package since release-05-00
---------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++

 * Variables :b2:var:`recQ2Bh`, :b2:var:`recMissM2`, :b2:var:`recQ2BhSimple` have been moved to a new variable group ``Specific kinematic variables``,
   and :b2:var:`recQ2Bh` is now using a `diamond frame method <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1442697>`_
 * Variable ``TagVmcLBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVLBoost` and variable ``TagVmcOBoost`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcTagVOBoost`
 * Variable ``mcDeltaL`` renamed to :b2:var:`mcDeltaBoost` as it represents mc-truth version of :b2:var:`DeltaBoost` variable
 * Added variables to get track information of V0 daughters from TrackFitResult in V0 objects:
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterNCDCHits(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNSVDHits(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNPXDHits(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterNVXDHits(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstSVDLayer(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstPXDLayer(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterFirstCDCLayer(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterLastCDCLayer(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterPValue(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmega(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambda(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0Error(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0Error(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaError(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0Error(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaError(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaPullWithTrueVertexAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0PullWithTrueVertexAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaPullWithTrueVertexAsPivot(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterD0PullWithOriginAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterPhi0PullWithOriginAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterOmegaPullWithOriginAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterZ0PullWithOriginAsPivot(i)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterTanLambdaPullWithOriginAsPivot(i)`,
  :b2:var:`v0DaughterTau(i,j)`, :b2:var:`v0DaughterCov(i,j)` in a new variable group ``V0Daughter``.
  These variables can be used for the V0s from reconstructDecay, but the information are taken from the TrackFitResult of daughters.

Modules
+++++++

  * The :b2:mod:`InclusiveDstarReconstruction` creates antiparticle lists correctly now. The module's input changed to a :ref:`DecayString` of the
    form ``D* -> pi`` and MC Matching is applicable (one can use :b2:var:`isSignal`).
 * In `BtubeCreator` module, functionality to apply a cut on the confidence level of the fit of fully reconstructed B to the
   beamspot is added.
