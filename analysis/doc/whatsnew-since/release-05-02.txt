Changes in the analysis package since release-05-02
---------------------------------------------------

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++

 * KFit has been extended to be able to handle vertex fits (with and without mass constraint) that involve an eta particle
   reconstructed in ``eta -> gamma gamma``.
 * Added a method `scaleError` in order to scale up helix errors and avoid underestimation of vertex error.
 * Added a new fit-type option ``massfourC`` to function :func:`vertex.kFit`. The kinematic fit is performed with the 4 momentum
   constraint of a mother particle and mass constraints of intermediate particles specified by the option ``massConstraint``,
   simultaneously.
 * Changed the treatment of Bremsstrahlungs-corrected tracks in `vertex.treeFit`. The previous implementation exhibited bad
   performance when a Bremsstrahlungs-photon is applied. The new implementation fits the corrected Track as a single particle,
   analogous to, what KFit does.

Variables
+++++++++

 * Variables :b2:var:`SoftwareTriggerResult`, :b2:var:`SoftwareTriggerResultNonPrescaled` and :b2:var:`SoftwareTriggerPrescaling`
   now silently return NAN if the trigger is not found.

   .. warning:: this no longer dumps all possible trigger names instead please see ``b2hlt_triggers`` for a list of all possible names.

   .. seealso:: ``b2hlt_triggers print --database online --format list``

 * Variables :b2:var:`recQ2Bh`, :b2:var:`recMissM2`, :b2:var:`recQ2BhSimple` have been moved to a new variable group ``Specific kinematic variables``,
   and :b2:var:`recQ2Bh` is now using a `diamond frame method <https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1442697>`_
 * Added the new variable :b2:var:`photonHasOverlap`, which determines whether a particle's cluster is sharing its connected
   region with another cluster. A cut string can be provided to ignore cluster that do not satisfy the specified criteria.
 * Variables `clusterThetaID` and `clusterPhiID` have both been added as a new variable
 * Event-based variables from ``cluster`` collection have been moved into a new ``event_level_cluster`` collection,
   collections of ROE and recoil variables have been expanded
 * A few binary PID variables have been added to the PID variable collection.
 * Added a new variable :b2:var:`nROE_Composites` to count V0 particles in ROE.
 * Added meta variables corresponding to existing variables that access the MC matched particles of given daughters
   :b2:var:`mcDaughterDiffOf` , :b2:var:`mcDaughterDiffOfPhi`, :b2:var:`mcDaughterDiffOfPhiCMS`, :b2:var:`mcDaughterAngle`.
 * Added the new variable :b2:var:`mcCosThetaBetweenParticleAndNominalB`. This is an MC version of
   :b2:var:`cosThetaBetweenParticleAndNominalB` in which all descendant neutrino momenta are subtracted from the B momentum
   during the calculation.
 * Added the inverse trigonometric functions: :b2:var:`acos`, :b2:var:`asin`.
 * Added new variables :b2:var:`exp` and :b2:var:`log`.
 * Added special hadron ID variables :b2:var:`pionID_SVD`, :b2:var:`kaonID_SVD`, :b2:var:`protonID_SVD`, :b2:var:`binaryPID_SVD`
   which include SVD PDFs for pions, kaons and protons only. For hadron ID, users should **no longer** rely on the standard
   variables :b2:var:`pionID`, :b2:var:`kaonID`, :b2:var:`protonID`, :b2:var:`binaryPID` for the time being. For lepton
   identification instead, the :b2:var:`electronID`, :b2:var:`muonID`, :b2:var:`binaryPID` variables, which do not contain SVD PDF
   info yet, are still recommended.
 * Added a new variable to clusters, `beamBackgroundProbabilityMVA`, which uses shower shape variables to separate between true
   photons and beam backgrounds.
 * Added ``b2help-variables`` which behaves identical to ``basf2 variables.py`` but more in-keeping with the ``b2help-<something>``
   theme.
 * The variables :b2:var:`EventType` and :b2:var:`trackMatchType` have been declared deprecated. Instead the variables
   :b2:var:`isMC` and :b2:var:`clusterTrackMatch` should be used.
 * New MCTruthVariable `isBBCrossfeed` checks for crossfeed in the reconstruction of the given B meson.
 * Modified the ``L1 Trigger`` variables (:b2:var:`L1PSNM`, :b2:var:`L1PSNMBit`, etc.) to return ``NAN`` instead of ``0`` in case the requested
   trigger bit or number does not exist. These variables now return ``0`` only when the requested bit is not fired.
 * Added new variables :b2:var:`L1TimeQuality` and :b2:var:`isPoissonTriggerInInjectionVeto` for returning the L1 trigger time quality and the injection veto flag. Renamed the variable ``L1TimType`` into :b2:var:`L1TimeType`.
 * Added a new variable :b2:var:`minC2TDistID` and a metavariable :b2:var:`minC2TDistVar`, which allow to call
   any variable for the nearest track to a given photon.
 * New variables have been added to classify the true decay mode of an event (e.g. :b2:var:`BplusMode` and :b2:var:`B0Mode`). They
   serve as an alternative to the `TopologyAnalysis`. Further information about the meaning of the variable values can be found in
   :b2:ref:`GeneratedDecayModes`.
 * Added new variables :b2:var:`useParticleRestFrame` and :b2:var:`useRecoilParticleRestFrame` for computing variables in the
   rest frame of a given Particle (or in the rest frame of the recoiling system of a given Particle). If the ParticleList passed
   to these variables contains more than one Particle, only the first one in the list will be considered.

Modules
+++++++

 * Added a module :b2:mod:`TrackIsoCalculator`, which takes as input a standard charged particle list, and calculates for every particle's track in the list the
   3D distance to the closest track in the event. The distance is calculated as the 3D separation between the points where two extrapolated track helices cross a given
   detector's inner surface, where the detector is an input parameter to the module. This variable can be used to parametrise charged particle
   identification efficiencies and mis-identification probabilities, as they can depend on the activity around each charged particle candidate.
 * The :b2:mod:`InclusiveDstarReconstruction` creates antiparticle lists correctly now. The module's input changed to a
   :ref:`DecayString` of the form ``D* -> pi`` and MC Matching is applicable (one can use :b2:var:`isSignal`).
 * In `BtubeCreator` module, functionality to apply a cut on the confidence level of the fit of fully reconstructed B to the
   beamspot is added.
 * The ``EventKinematics`` module can now compute event kinematics using generated particles as an input.
 * Arguments of `writePi0EtaVeto` have been updated. ``downloadFlag`` and ``workingDirectory`` have been removed since the
   download processes can be skipped. New arguments have been added for several reasons. ``suffix`` allows to calculate this
   veto for multiple photons. ``hardParticle`` allows to call this function for a given particle other than a photon.
   Four new arguments have been added to override the payload names and soft photon selections, ``pi0PayloadNameOverride``,
   ``etaPayloadNameOverride``, ``pi0SoftPhotonCutOverride``, and ``etaSoftPhotonCutOverride``.
 * A new helper method `updateROEUsingV0Lists` has been added to facilitate application of V0Finder results in Rest Of Event.
 * Added a possibility to add a ROE mask for KLM-based particles and an experimental option of including KLM-based particles into
   ROE 4-vector computation.

   .. warning:: The option ``useKLMEnergy`` of `RestOfEventBuilder` module is only meant for performance studies and NOT for a physics analysis.

 * The :b2:mod:`PrintMCParticles` module and thus also the `printMCParticles` function
   has a completely new layout that should be much easier to parse, especially for complicated events. By default it shows
   much less information but in an easier to parse tree representation. See the documentation of `printMCParticles` for details.
 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` now creates photon candidates from KLMCluster if the parameter ``loadPhotonsFromKLM`` is set to
   true. It is off by default.

   .. warning:: Photons from KLMCluster should only be used in specific use-cases and after a thorough study of their effect.

 * In :b2:mod:`BtubeCreator`, new extrainfo ``TubeB_p_estimated`` was added. This returns the magnitude of the estimated momentum
   of the B which should fly in the direction of the Btube.
 * Added a module :b2:mod:`HelixErrorScaler`, which multiplies constant scaling factors to helix errors of input charged particles
   and stores them in a new list.
 * In :b2:mod:`ParticleStats` add functionality to produce a json containing the information printed on stdout. Added also a tool :ref:`b2plot-particleStats` to analyze the json and produce some plots.
 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module has been extended. A ParticleList of composite particles can now be processed as well. In
   that case the momenta of all track-based daughter particles are scaled by the provided factor.
 * The wrapper functions for the tracking systematics modules have been renamed from ``trackingMomentum`` to `scaleTrackMomenta`
   and from ``trackingEfficiency`` to `removeTracksForTrackingEfficiencyCalculation`.
 * Added the :b2:mod:`TauDecayMode` module, which is an actualization of the :b2:mod:`TauDecayMarker` module for the new
   TauolaBelle decays. Using a txt file, which defines the mapping between decay strings and decay numbers from TauolaBelle, the
   module assigns a decay number for each tau in the event. This decay number is stored in the variables :b2:var:`tauMinusMCMode`
   and :b2:var:`tauPlusMCMode`. It's possible to provide the path of a different txt file for the mapping as a parameter to the
   module.
 * Added a `EnergyBiasCorrection` module, sub-percent correction only applied to E of photons not on clusterE and should only
   be applied on data. `correctEnergyBias` is a corresponding wrapper function.

Full Event Interpretation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added option to reconstruct strange B mesons (at Y(5S)) in 51 decay channels. Can be switched on with the ``strangeB`` flag in
   `fei.get_default_channels()`.
 * The FEI has been retrained with MC14 and release-05. The prefix ``FEIv4_2021_MC14_release_05_01_12`` has to be set in the FEI
   configuration.

Standard Particle Lists
+++++++++++++++++++++++

 * The selection criteria of the pi0 standard particle lists have been updated from the January 2020 to the May 2020
   recommendations.
