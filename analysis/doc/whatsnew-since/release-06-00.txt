Changes in the analysis package since release-06-00
---------------------------------------------------

Neutral Hadron Analysis Tool
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added a module that modifies 4-momentum of a neutral hadron in a given decay (e.g. :math:`B^0 \to J/\psi K_L^0`, :math:`B^0 \to
   p \bar{n} D^*(2010)^-`).
 * Added a Python function `reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron`, which merges the functionalities of ``ParticleCombiner`` and the
   above module.

Variables
+++++++++

 * Removed ``R2EventLevel`` (it has been officially deprecated since release-05).
 * Modified ``InvM`` to be calculated at the decay vertex if the particle is V0 or decay at rho > 5 mm.
 * Added ``clusterTotalMCMatchWeight`` which returns the sum of all deposited MC energies that can be used to identify beam
   background clusters.
 * The no ROE mask case in the ROE-related variables has now a different name: ``"all"`` instead of an empty string ``""``.
   Similarly to the ParticleLoader's ``all`` particle lists, this name is reserved, user cannot create a mask with this name. 
   If ``maskName`` argument is not specified in the ROE-related metavariables, it will default to ``all`` automatically, 
   but in case of metavariables with many arguments user will be required to call it explicitly, e.g. ``nROE_Charged(all, 321)``. 
 * Added ``v0DaughterNRemovedHits`` which returns the number of track hits removed in V0Finder.
 * Added `hadronicSplitOffSuppression` which returns the output of an MVA that uses shower-related variables to distinguish
   between true photons and hadronic split-offs.
 * The variable ``beamBackgroundProbabilityMVA`` now has a new name: `beamBackgroundSuppression`. The weight files for this 
   MVA have also been updated due to a change in training samples used. 
 * Added `mostcommonBTagIndex` which returns the B meson index from which most FSP from a given reconstructed B meson candidate originated. Use case would be e.g. the FEI.
 * Added `percentageMissingParticlesBTag` which determines the percentage of FSP missed by using the `mostcommonBTagIndex` of the B meson.
 * Added `percentageWrongParticlesBTag` which gives the percentage of FSP reconstructed not originating from the `mostcommonBTagIndex`.

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module has been extended. Now the module can scale track momenta based on phase-space dependent
   scaling factors given which are read from payloads according to parameters ``tableName`` and ``scalingFactorName``. The
   corresponding wrapper function `scaleTrackMomenta` has been also extended accordingly.
 * The :b2:mod:`HelixErrorScaler` has been extended to K_S0 that are reconstructed from V0. A new python function
   `stdV0s.scaleErrorKshorts` provides an alternative to the standard list ``K_S0:merged`` with a correction applied to the
   uncertainties of the K_S0 daughter helix parameters.
 * Variables `nRejectedECLShowersFWDEndcap`, `nRejectedECLShowersBarrel`, `nRejectedECLShowersBWDEndcap`: if the values of the
   counters exceed uint8_t maximum (255), it is set to 255.
 * The invariant mass of the particles built from the missing momentum in the event (`fillParticleListFromROE` with option
   ``useMissing=True``) is no longer fixed to zero, but set based on the full missing 4-momentum.
 * A cut provided to the `ParticleCombiner` was always applied to the daughter particle combination, even when choosing one of the
   two recoil options. Now it is applied to the created mother particle as written in the documentation. This changes the behavior
   of `reconstructRecoil` and `reconstructRecoilDaughter`.
