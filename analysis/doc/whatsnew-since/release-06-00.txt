Changes in the analysis package in light-2207-bengal
----------------------------------------------------

PID Calibration Weight Tools
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Added the module ``scripts/pidDataUtils.py`` to provide a set of tools for preparing and analyzing data with weights
 * Added the script ``scripts/pidTrainWeights.py`` to train a set of calibration weights on a dataset
 * Added an example for training a set of weights and using them in an analysis in ``analysis/examples/PIDCalibration``

Variables
+++++++++
 * Added the variable `pionID_noARICHwoECL` which returns pionID without using ARICH likelihood for tracks without associated
   ECL cluster. 
 * Added the variable `kaonID_noARICHwoECL` which returns kaonID without using ARICH likelihood for tracks without associated
   ECL cluster. 
 * Added the metavariable `binaryPID_noARICHwoECL` which returns binary PID without using ARICH likelihood 
   for tracks without associated ECL cluster.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2205-abys
--------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
 * Added the variable `nPrimaryMCParticles` which returns the number of primary MC particles.
 * Added the variable `nVirtualPrimaryMCParticles` which returns the number of virtual primary MC particles.
 * Added the variable `nInitialPrimaryMCParticles` which returns the number of initial primary MC particles.
 * Changed the `nCompositeDaughters` so that one can specify the PDG code of composite daughters.
   If no argument is given, it works same as before. Please note that brackets have to appended even if no argument is given i.e.
   ``nCompositeDaughters()``.
 * Added `nCompositeAllGenerationDaughters` which works similar with `nCompositeDaughters` but it includes all generations of
   daughters.
 * Added optional argument to `helixExtTheta`, `helixExtPhi` to allow performing the extrapolation using the mass hypothesis that
   provides the best track fit result, regardless of the particle object's PDG.
 * Users can clear aliases by using ``variables.clearAliases()``, which is useful when processing several independent ``Path``
   objects in a single basf2 session, e.g. b2luigi job submission.
 * Added the variable `cosAngleBetweenMomentumAndBoostVector` which returns the cosine of angle between momentum and boost vector.

Modules
+++++++
 * Added an option ``basketsize`` to :func:`modularAnalysis.variablesToNtuple` to set the size of TBaskets in the output ntuple in
   bytes.
 * Added an argument ``reference_list_name`` to :func:`modularAnalysis.calculateTrackIsolation`. The reference ParticleList is used
   as reference to calculate the distance for the input ParticleList given by ``input_list``. By default, the ``:all`` list of the
   same particle type as the ``input_list`` is used.
 * The :b2:mod:`TrackIsoCalculator` and :b2:mod:`ChargedPidMVA` modules now support decay string grammar, 
   which allows to run these modules on daughter or granddaughter particles.
 * In the CDC volume, the calculation of track-to-closest-neighbour distance in the :b2:mod:`TrackIsoCalculator` module now is done
   for 9 surface layers (was only at the entry surface). Also, the definition of distance has been changed to adapt to each
   sub-detector's geometrical segmentation.
 * In the :b2:mod:`TrackIsoCalculator` module, added an option to calculate the distance using the track fit result of the most
   probable mass hypothesis for the particles in the reference list.

MC Truth Information
++++++++++++++++++++
 * The :b2:mod:`PrintMCParticles` and :b2:mod:`VariablesToNtuple` (:b2:mod:`VariablesToEventBasedTree`) are extended.
   The MCParticles information printed by the :b2:mod:`PrintMCParticles` module can be stored in TTree via
   :b2:mod:`VariablesToNtuple` and :b2:mod:`VariablesToEventBasedTree`. When the :b2:mod:`PrintMCParticles`
   is called, the branch ``__MCDecayString__`` is automatically created and the same information that is printed
   by the :b2:mod:`PrintMCParticles`.
 * An argument ``suppressPrint`` is added to `modularAnalysis.printMCParticles` to suppress printing the information
   on the log message. This option helps to reduce the size of the log message while keeping the branch
   ``__MCDecayString__`` in a TTree.

MVA-based K_S0 Selector
+++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Added a new function :func:`ksSelector.ksSelector`, which applies MVA-based selection of K_S0 particleList
 * Added a example for usage and training of ``ksSelector`` at ``B2A910``, ``B2A911``, and ``B2A912``

Changes in the analysis package in light-2203-zeus
--------------------------------------------------

Lepton ID Analysis Helper
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Added :func:`stdCharged.stdLep` helper to build standard lepton lists for a number of supported working
   points and LID methods (Likelihood ratio or BDT, global or binary). The helper also decorates the particles with the
   recommended Data/MC corrections and associated uncertainties for efficiency and fake rates, based on the chosen GT.

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++
 * Fixed the calculation of kinematics after vertex KFit with selected particles. Disabled the feature of selecting fit particles
   for KFit except for vertex fit.

Variables
+++++++++
 * Removed ``EventType``, which was deprecated for more than a year since light-2012-minos.
 * Deprecated the variable `daughterInvariantMass`, which duplicates `daughterInvM`.
 * Added new Flavor Tagger related meta-variables to use ROE-mask correctly, ``pMissTag``, ``cosTPTO``, ``ptTracksRoe``,
   ``pt2TracksRoe``, ``isMajorityInRestOfEventFromB0``, ``isMajorityInRestOfEventFromB0bar``, ``hasRestOfEventTracks``, and
   ``isRelatedRestOfEventMajorityB0Flavor``. Added an argument ``maskName`` to ``BtagToWBosonVariables``.
 * Added the variable `trackFitCovariance`, which returns the track fit covariance matrix element corresponding to the two provided
   indices.

Modules
+++++++
 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module can now also smear track momenta based on phase-space dependent smearing factors which are
   read from payloads according to parameters ``payloadName`` and ``smearingFactorName``. The corresponding wrapper function
   `smearTrackMomenta` has been added. The argument ``tableName`` has been renamed as ``payloadName`` in `scaleTrackMomenta`.
 * Added an option ``skipNonPrimary`` to ``fillParticleListFromMC`` and ``fillParticleListsFromMC``.
 * Added an argument ``prefix`` to :func:`flavorTagger.flavorTagger` so that one can choose the version of weight files.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2112-uranus
----------------------------------------------------

Vertex Fitting
++++++++++++++
 * Added a new fit-type option ``recoilmass`` to function :func:`vertex.kFit`. The kinematic fit is performed with a constraint
   of a recoil mass specified by the option ``recoilMass``.
 * Fixed a bug in ``fourC`` and ``massfourC`` kfit. The mass of final-state particles were not fixed in old version.

Variables
+++++++++
 * Added the variable `TracksLBoostChi2`, which returns the change of the track positions in the boost direction after a vertex KFit
   in terms of a :math:`\chi^2` value.

Modules
+++++++
 * A cut provided to the `ParticleCombiner` was always applied to the daughter particle combination, even when choosing one of the
   two recoil options. Now it is applied to the created mother particle as written in the documentation. This changes the behavior
   of `reconstructRecoil` and `reconstructRecoilDaughter`.
 * The :b2:mod:`ParticleKinematicFitter` module has been extended to support the fit in which an additional unmeasured photon is
   assumed along HER/LER. To use the feature, one has to set ``addUnmeasuredPhoton`` and ``fixUnmeasuredToHER``
   (``fixUnmeasuredToLER``) to ``true``.
 * Added a `Pi0VetoEfficiencySystematics` module to obtain pi0 veto efficiency Data/MC weights, their statistical and systematic
   errors as extrainfo variables for a given hard photon and the veto threshold. `addPi0VetoEfficiencySystematics` is a
   corresponding wrapper function. The allowed range of the veto threshold is extended to (0.10,0.99).

PID Priors
++++++++++
 * Added ``analysis-train-priors`` tool that trains a pytorch model for calculating PID priors using an ntuple containing momentum
   and cos(:math:`\theta`) information. It generates a second order combination of the previously mentioned variables along with
   transverse momentum giving a total of nine features and trains the model using a taylor series of cross entropy loss to reduce
   the effect of outliers on the training.
 * For evaluating priors, ``evalPriors`` module containing the ``Priors`` class has been added to calculate these using
   the trained model. Additionally, posteriors can also be obtained by providing PID's from the detector signals.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2110-tartarus
------------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
 * The no ROE mask case in the ROE-related variables has now a different name: ``"all"`` instead of an empty string ``""``.
   Similarly to the ParticleLoader's ``all`` particle lists, this name is reserved, user cannot create a mask with this name.
   If ``maskName`` argument is not specified in the ROE-related metavariables, it will default to ``all`` automatically,
   but in case of metavariables with many arguments user will be required to call it explicitly, e.g. ``nROE_Charged(all, 321)``.
 * Added ``v0DaughterNRemovedHits`` which returns the number of track hits removed in V0Finder.
 * Added `hadronicSplitOffSuppression` which returns the output of an MVA that uses shower-related variables to distinguish
   between true photons and hadronic split-offs.
 * The variable ``beamBackgroundProbabilityMVA`` now has a new name: `beamBackgroundSuppression`. The weight files for this
   MVA have also been updated due to a change in training samples used.
 * Added `mostcommonBTagIndex` which returns the B meson index from which most FSP from a given reconstructed B meson candidate
   originated. Use case would be e.g. the FEI.
 * Added `percentageMissingParticlesBTag` which determines the percentage of FSP missed by using the `mostcommonBTagIndex` of the B
   meson.
 * Added `percentageWrongParticlesBTag` which gives the percentage of FSP reconstructed not originating from the
   `mostcommonBTagIndex`.

Modules
+++++++
 * Variables `nRejectedECLShowersFWDEndcap`, `nRejectedECLShowersBarrel`, `nRejectedECLShowersBWDEndcap`: if the values of the
   counters exceed uint8_t maximum (255), it is set to 255.
 * The invariant mass of the particles built from the missing momentum in the event (`fillParticleListFromROE` with option
   ``useMissing=True``) is no longer fixed to zero, but set based on the full missing 4-momentum.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2108-selene
----------------------------------------------------

Neutral Hadron Analysis Tool
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Added a module that modifies 4-momentum of a neutral hadron in a given decay (e.g. :math:`B^0 \to J/\psi K_L^0`, :math:`B^0 \to
   p \bar{n} D^*(2010)^-`).
 * Added a Python function `reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron`, which merges the functionalities of ``ParticleCombiner`` and the
   above module.

Variables
+++++++++
 * Removed ``R2EventLevel`` (it has been officially deprecated since release-05).
 * Modified ``InvM`` to be calculated at the decay vertex if the particle is V0 or decay at rho > 5 mm.
 * Added ``clusterTotalMCMatchWeight`` which returns the sum of all deposited MC energies that can be used to identify beam
   background clusters.

Modules
+++++++
 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module has been extended. Now the module can scale track momenta based on phase-space dependent
   scaling factors given which are read from payloads according to parameters ``tableName`` and ``scalingFactorName``. The
   corresponding wrapper function `scaleTrackMomenta` has also been extended accordingly.
 * The :b2:mod:`HelixErrorScaler` has been extended to K_S0 that are reconstructed from V0. A new python function
   `stdV0s.scaleErrorKshorts` provides an alternative to the standard list ``K_S0:merged`` with a correction applied to the
   uncertainties of the K_S0 daughter helix parameters.
