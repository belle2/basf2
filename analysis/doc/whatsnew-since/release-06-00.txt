Changes in the analysis package since release-06-00
---------------------------------------------------

Neutral Hadron Analysis Tool
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added a module that modifies 4-momentum of a neutral hadron in a given decay (e.g. :math:`B^0 \to J/\psi K_L^0`, :math:`B^0 \to p \bar{n} D^*(2010)^-`).
 * Added a Python function `reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron`, which merges the functionalities of ``ParticleCombiner`` and the above module.

Variables
+++++++++

* Removed ``R2EventLevel`` (it has been officially deprecated since release-05).
* Modified ``InvM`` to be calculated at the decay vertex if the particle is V0 or decay at rho > 5 mm.

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module has been extended. Now the module can scale track momenta based on phase-space dependent scaling 
   factors given which are read from payloads according to parameters ``tableName`` and ``scalingFactorName``. The corresponding wrapper function
   `scaleTrackMomenta` has been also extended accordingly. 

 * The :b2:mod:`HelixErrorScaler` has been extended to K_S0 that are reconstructed from V0. A new python function
   `stdV0s.scaleErrorKshorts` provides an alternative to the standard list ``K_S0:merged`` with a correction applied to the
   uncertainties of the K_S0 daughter helix parameters.
* Added ``clusterTotalMCMatchWeight`` which returns the sum of all deposited MC energies that can be used to identify beam background clusters.
