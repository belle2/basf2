Changes in the analysis package since release-06-00
---------------------------------------------------

Neutral Hadron Analysis Tool
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added a module that modifies 4-momentum of a neutral hadron in a given decay (e.g. :math:`B^0 \to J/\psi K_L^0`, :math:`B^0 \to p \bar{n} D^*(2010)^-`).
 * Added a Python function `reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron`, which merges the functionalities of ``ParticleCombiner`` and the above module.

Variables
+++++++++

* Removed ``R2EventLevel`` (it has been officially deprecated since release-05).

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module has been extended. Now the module can scale track momenta based on phase-space dependent scaling 
   factors given which are read from payloads according to parameters ``tableName`` and ``scalingFactorName``. The corresponding wrapper function
   `scaleTrackMomenta` has been also extended accordingly.
