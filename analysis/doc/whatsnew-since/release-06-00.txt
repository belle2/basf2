Changes in the analysis package since release-06-00
---------------------------------------------------

Neutral Hadron Analysis Tool
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 * Added a module that modifies 4-momentum of a neutral hadron in a given decay (e.g. :math:`B^0 \to J/\psi K_L^0`, :math:`B^0 \to p \bar{n} D^*(2010)^-`).
 * Added a Python function `reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron`, which merges the functionalities of ``ParticleCombiner`` and the above module.

Variables
+++++++++

 * Removed ``R2EventLevel`` (it has been officially deprecated since release-05).
 * Modified ``InvM`` to be calculated at the decay vertex if the particle is V0 or decay at rho > 5 mm.
 * Added ``clusterTotalMCMatchWeight`` which returns the sum of all deposited MC energies that can be used to identify beam
   background clusters.
 * The no ROE mask case in the ROE-related variables has now a different name: ``"all"`` instead of an empty string ``""``.
   Similarly to the ParticleLoader's ``all`` particle lists, this name is reserved, user cannot create a mask with this name. 
   If ``maskName`` argument is not specified in the ROE-related metavariables, it will default to ``all`` automatically, 
   but in case of metavariables with many arguments user will be required to call it explicitly, e.g. ``nROE_Charged(all, 321)``. 
 * Added `mostcommonBTagIndex` which returns the B meson index from which most FSP from a given reconstructed B meson candidate originated. Use case would be e.g. the FEI.
 * Added `percentageMissingParticlesBTag` which determines the percentage of FSP missed by using the `mostcommonBTagIndex` of the B meson.
 * Added `percentageWrongParticlesBTag` which gives the percentage of FSP reconstructed not originating from the `mostcommonBTagIndex`.

Modules
+++++++

 * The :b2:mod:`TrackingMomentum` module has been extended. Now the module can scale track momenta based on phase-space dependent
   scaling factors given which are read from payloads according to parameters ``tableName`` and ``scalingFactorName``. The
   corresponding wrapper function `scaleTrackMomenta` has been also extended accordingly.
 * The :b2:mod:`HelixErrorScaler` has been extended to K_S0 that are reconstructed from V0. A new python function
   `stdV0s.scaleErrorKshorts` provides an alternative to the standard list ``K_S0:merged`` with a correction applied to the
   uncertainties of the K_S0 daughter helix parameters.
