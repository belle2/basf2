A module that calculates the 4-momentum of neutral hadron in a given decay (e.g. :math:`B^0 \to J/\psi K_L^0`, :math:`B^0 \to p \bar{n} D^*(2010)^-`) has been developed. As this module directly modifies the 4-momentum of the Particle, all kinematic variables involving the neutral hadron will also be updated. A Python function `reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron` has also been developed, which merges the functionalities of ``ParticleCombiner`` and this module.
