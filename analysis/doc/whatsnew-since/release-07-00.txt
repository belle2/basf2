Changes in the analysis package in light-2209-calico
----------------------------------------------------

MVA-based pi0 identification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * New function :func:`modularAnalysis.lowEnergyPi0Identification` providing MVA-based pi0 identification is added.
 * Example of its usage is added as ``analysis/examples/PostMdstIdentification/LowEnergyPi0Identification.py``.

Variables
+++++++++
 * Extended the variable `useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis` to variables calculated from daughters' 4-momentum, e.g.
   `cosHelicityAngleMomentum`.
 * Added metavariable to retrieve the distance to the closest neighbour at a detector surface (based on track helix extrapolation): `minET2ETDist`.
 * Added metavariable to retrieve any variable associated to the closest neighbour at a detector surface from the reference particle list: `minET2ETDistVar`.

Modules
+++++++
 * New modules :b2:mod:`LowEnergyPi0VetoExpert` and :b2:mod:`LowEnergyPi0IdentificationExpert` for MVA-based pi0
   identification are added.

Modular Analysis Function
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Added a check to the `applyEventCuts` function to make sure that only event-based variables are used in the
   selection. The decomposition of meta variables can be tricky, so a new argument ``metavariables`` is added to extend
   the list of meta variables which should be decomposed and should themselves be ignored in the check.
 * Updated the `calculateTrackIsolation` helper. Now, it returns a list of metavariables (`minET2ETDist`, optionally `minET2ETDistVar` as well)
   correctly configured according to the helper input options.
   Users can then create aliases in their own steering script: see ``analysis/examples/VariableManager/trackIsolationVariables.py`` for an example.
 * The default argument of :func:`flavorTagger.flavorTagger` is updated so that the weight files trained with MC15ri will be used as default.
   If one wants to use the previous weight files, the arguments should be set as follows: ``maskName='all'`` and ``prefix=''``.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2207-bengal
----------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
 * Added the variables of the PID probability with the calibration weights, `weightedElectronID`, `weightedMuonID`,
   `weightedPionID`, `weightedKaonID`, `weightedProtonID`, and `weightedDeuteronID`.
   Also, the expert PID variables were added, `pidWeightedLogLikelihoodValueExpert`, `pidWeightedPairProbabilityExpert`,
   and `pidWeightedProbabilityExpert`.
 * Added the variable `hasCorrectROECombination` to check if the correct combination of the particle that is the basis of
   the ROE object and the particle that is loaded from the ROE.

Modules
+++++++
 * Fixed a bug in the :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`. The relationship of the pdg code between the loaded
   particle and the source particle was inconsistent when the loaded particle was not a self-conjugated particle.
