Changes in the analysis package in light-2207-bengal
----------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
 * Added the variables of the PID probability with the calibration weights, `weightedElectronID`, `weightedMuonID`,
   `weightedPionID`, `weightedKaonID`, `weightedProtonID`, and `weightedDeuteronID`.
   Also, the expert PID variables were added, `pidWeightedLogLikelihoodValueExpert`, `pidWeightedPairProbabilityExpert`,
   and `pidWeightedProbabilityExpert`.
 * Added the variable `hasCorrectROECombination` to check if the correct combination of the particle that is the basis of
   the ROE object and the particle that is loaded from the ROE.

Modules
+++++++
 * Fixed a bug in the :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`. The relationship of the pdg code between the loaded
   particle and the source particle was inconsistent when the loaded particle was not a self-conjugated particle.
