Changes in the analysis package in light-2305-korat
---------------------------------------------------

Geometric matching of KL and neutrons to ECL clusters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added a new module and a helper function ``getNeutralHadronGeomMatches`` to perform geometric match between generated neutral hadrons
  (KL and neutrons) to ECL clusters. The function optinally provides efficiency correction to the simulation to improve KL modelling in ECL.
  The function creates additional variables ``mcdistanceKL``, ``mdstIndexTruthKL`` for KL and ``mcdistanceNeutron``,
  ``mdstIndexTruthNeutron`` for neutrons, respectively.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added new variable `trackLength` that returns the arc length from the track origin to the last CDC layer associated to the track.
* A bug affecting the variables `flightTimeOfDaughter`, `flightTimeOfDaughterErr`,
  `flightDistanceOfDaughter`, and `flightDistanceOfDaughterErr` has been fixed, which caused the
  return value to be NaN if the composite daughter particle was a V0 object.

Reconstruction of V0s
+++++++++++++++++++++
* `stdKshorts` and `stdLambdas`: removed a pre-vertex-fit cut on the invariant mass of ``K_S0``/``Lambda0``
  candidates found by the ``V0Finder`` module. The cut was not useful, as ``V0Finder`` already applies a cut
  on its candidates, and could discard signal candidates with very displaced vertex due to the
  ``K_S0``/``Lambda0`` vertex being assumed at the origin before the fit, affecting the invariant mass computation.
  The post-fit cut on the invariant mass is still present. Cuts on ``K_S0``/``Lambda0`` candidates found by `reconstructDecay`
  are still the same as before.

Command line tools
++++++++++++++++++
* The command line tool :ref:`b2help-variables <b2help-variables>` is extended to get a description of specific variables and to
  display only their data.


Changes in the analysis package in light-2303-iriomote
------------------------------------------------------
Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in the `EventShapeCalculator` module and `modularAnalysis.buildEventShape` that was introduced in
  ``light-2302-genetta``. Meaningless values were provided for the event-shape variables.
* Fixed a bug on the `findMCDecay` that creates duplicated particles which differ only in the order of their daughters.
* Fixed a bug of the TreeFit that affected the initialization of vertex position that is calculated from two track helices.
  This bug mainly affected particles that decay far from the IP, specifically ``V0`` particles such as ``K_S0``.
  The bugfix recovers the inefficiency of those particles.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added new charged PID variables `kaonIDNN` and `pionIDNN` representing the probability for the given hypothesis, calculated
  from a neural network that uses high-level information such as PID likelihoods, track momentum and charge.
  The probabilities are unaffected by momentum updates in vertex fits or the application of the track momentum scale correction.


Changes in the analysis package in light-2302-genetta
-----------------------------------------------------

Charm Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++++++++
* The Charm Flavor Tagger algorithm has been added in ``analysis/scripts/charmFlavorTagger.py``. This allows for the determination
  of the signal flavor of neutral D mesons with information from the ROE. The CFT output, qr, is saved in the extraInfo field of
  the signal particle.

MCMatching of K_S0
++++++++++++++++++
* Modified the MCMatching algorithm for the ``K_S0`` particle. The MCError flags of missing daughters (e.g.
  ``c_MissMassiveParticle``. please see :ref:`Error_flags`) was not assigned to the ``K_S0``. It was not a problem for the
  :math:`K_S^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-` process, because ``K_S0`` fails to be matched to the MCParticle when one of ``pi+`` is missed.
  However, when the ``K_S0`` decays interacting with the detector material, it can have many daughters. If the ``K_S0`` is
  reconstructed from two pions of these daughters, it was considered as "signal" (i.e. ``isSignal==1``) even though its
  kinematics was wrongly reconstructed.
  We modified the MCMatching algorithm and assigned the MCError flags of missing daughters on the ``K_S0`` properly. The most of
  "fake-signal" ``K_S0`` candidates are now correctly identified as background (i.e. ``isSignal==0``).
* There remains a small fraction of "fake-signal" candidates that decay interacting with the detector material but having only
  two pions. The effect is expected to be small, for example, that is about ``0.0005%`` in the tau-LFV process,
  :math:`\tau^- \to \ell^- K_S^0 K_S^0`. You can identify such events with the `mcSecPhysProc` variable that returns the secondary
  process of the Geant4, namely ``countFSPDaughters(mcPrimary==0 and mcSecPhysProc!=201)>0``.

Graph Neural Network based Flavor Tagger
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* The Graph Neural Network based Flavor Tagger is available from the basf2. The new options ``useGNN`` and ``identifierGNN`` are
  added to `flavorTagger.flavorTagger`. If ``useGNN`` is set to ``True`` and ``identifierGNN`` is set to the trained weight file
  name, the qr value is stored in the alias variable ``qrGNN``. One can find the information on the identifier and the global tag
  which includes the payload on the `TDCPV WG Confluence Page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Recipes+for+TDCPV+tools>`_.

Modules
+++++++
* New function `modularAnalysis.estimateAndAttachTrackFitResult` and module `TrackFitResultEstimator` are added. It creates a
  ``TrackFitResult`` from the momentum of the Particle and creates a relation between them. The main use case is the tracking
  efficiency study by extrapolating the recoil particle to the detector surfaces.
* Removed the prepending of the analysis global tag inside the modularAnalysis functions, `lowEnergyPi0Identification`,
  `getBeamBackgroundProbability`, `getFakePhotonProbability`, and `getNbarIDMVA`, so that the priority of global tags gets clearer.
* Fixed a bug on the `findMCDecay` that the decay of ``K_S0`` cannot be specified.
* Added an option ``usePhotonOnlyOnce`` to the function :func:`modularAnalysis.correctBremsBelle`. The default of the option is
  ``False`` so the backward compatibility. If the option is set to ``True``, a photon is used for only the closest charged particle
  in the input ParticleLists.
* Modified parameters for the functions :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleList` and :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleLists` so
  that they no longer contain parameters that load the beam background or fake photon (formerly hadronic split-off) MVA.
* Parameters for `stdPhotons`, `stdPi0s` and `stdHyperons` have been changed in both name and type. The new parameters are called
  ``beamBackgroundMVAWeight`` and ``fakePhotonMVAWeight``, and they are now strings to specify which weight files should be used. For
  run-independent training use ``MCri`` while for run-dependent training use ``MCrd``. More information on the new weights can be
  found on the `Neutrals Performance Confluence Page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Neutrals+Performance>`_.
* Added an optional parameter ``biasCorrectionTable`` to `stdHyperons` so that users can specify a table name with photon energy
  bias corrections for the ``stdXi0`` particle list. The latest information on the bias correction can be found on the `Neutrals
  Performance Confluence Page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Neutrals+Performance>`_.
* Added a parameter ``updateAllDaughters`` to `stdKshorts` and `stdLambdas` so that users can instruct the vertex fitter to
  update the variables of the V0 daughters. The parameter is ``False`` by default for backward compatibility.
* New function `modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromChargedCluster` is added to load the neutral final-state-particles from the
  ECL and KLM clusters that are being matched with the Track of input ParticleList.
* Added the argument ``ignoreFromVertexFit`` in :func:`vertex.treeFit` to ignore particles to determine the vertex position. The
  kinematics of the particles are treated as constant. The ``ignoreFromVertexFit`` option is expected to be used to perform fit
  without ``K_L0`` or mimic a ``K_S0`` or a ``pi0`` with a control channel by ignoring a track for vertex fit. While,
  ``treatAsInvisible`` will ignore both for vertex and kinematics. The ``treatAsInvisible`` option is expected to recover an
  invisible particle's kinematics from beam-constraint.
* Fixed a bug of the TreeFit with the Bremsstrahlung correction tools, `modularAnalysis.correctBrems` and
  `modularAnalysis.correctBremsBelle`. The position uncertainties of the brems-corrected particle were wrongly assigned.
  This bug does not affect the kinematics very much but induces a bias on the position and its uncertainty.
* Allowed ``-o`` argument of basf2 to override the output ROOT filename of `VariablesToNtuple`, `VariablesToEventBasedTree`, and
  `VariablesToHistogram` modules, e.g. ``basf2 script.py -o new.root``. If the modules are called more than once, the override will
  be applied to all output files. If you need to save multiple TTrees with the same name, please use the new argument
  ``filenameSuffix`` of `modularAnalysis.variablesToNtuple` to differentiate the output files. The ``filenameSuffix`` is appended to
  the output ROOT file name even if the ``-o`` argument is used.
* Fixed a bug on `NeutralHadron4MomentumCalculator` that misplaces the neutral hadron daughter's index after calculating its momentum.
* New function `modularAnalysis.extractParticlesFromROE` and module `ParticleExtractorFromROE` are implemented.
  The function extracts Particle objects that belong to a ROE and fills them in ParticleLists. It is available both in the
  ``for_each`` loop over the ROEs (e.g. ``roe_path``) and the main path if the signal side ParticleList has only one candidate.
* Added a module ``BelleNbarMVA`` that applies nbarMVA for Belle, a DNN trained with ECLCluster variables for discrimination of
  anti-neutrons against photons. Anti-neutron-like particles have scores closer to 1; photon-like particles have scores closer to
  0.
* New interface for module `TrackIsoCalculator` that allow creating a single module instance for multiple detectors.
  The module now also calculates an isolation score per particle according to a new definition (see Variables).
* Fixed a bug of the TreeFit with the particle loaded from the KLMCluster. The mass of the particle, which should have been fixed
  with the PDG value, was floated in the TreeFit. Now it is fixed and the fit results get more reasonable.
  However, since the covariance matrix of the KLMCluster is not properly set yet, the performance of the TreeFit with these
  particles is not guaranteed.
* Added an option ``overwriteRank`` to the `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest` and `modularAnalysis.rankByLowest` to overwrite the
  extraInfo of rank when the particle has already the extraInfo.

Variables
+++++++++
* New variable `momentaTripleProduct` is added for the searches for CP violation via T-odd correlations in multi-body decays.
* Added the variables `EcmsMC` and `totalEnergyMC`, which return the true value of :math:`\sqrt{s}` and the true sum of the
  energies of all generated particles, respectively.
* Deprecated `hadronicSplitOffSuppression` which has been replaced with `fakePhotonSuppression`
* New variables `countFSPDaughters` and `countDescendants` are added to get number of daughters which passes the given selection.
* New meta-variables `originalParticle` and `originalDaughter` are added to get the variable of the original particle from which
  the given particle or the specified daughter. One can get the variables of the daughters particles before they are updated by the
  vertex fit, for example.
* New variables `helixExtThetaOnDet` and `helixExtPhiOnDet` are added. They returns theta and phi of extrapolated helix parameters
  on the detector surface given by the argument.
* New variable `clusterBestMatchedMCParticle` is added to access the MCParticle that is related to the ECLCluster but not to the
  Particle object.
* New variable `minET2ETIsoScoreAsWeightedAvg` that returns a particle's isolation score based on a weighted average of inverse distances
  at each input detector layers.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2212-foldex
----------------------------------------------------
ParticleList dataobject
+++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added new member variable ``isReserved`` to prevent the reserved ParticleLists (``:all`` labeled final-state particles, and
  ``:V0`` labeled V0-particles) from being changed. While some modules have already had protection not to edit the reserved lists,
  e.g. `ParticleSelector` and `ParticleListManipulator`, the other modules editing the ParticleList had the potential to introduce
  critical bugs. If one's script breaks due to the update since the ``light-2212-foldex``, please modify the script not to edit
  the reserved ParticleLists by copying them with other names beforehand.

Signal embedding
++++++++++++++++
* New modules `UdstListFilter` and `PostMergeUpdater` for signal embedding which remove extra ``mdst`` objects and merge events
  together, respectively.
* New scripts ``udst_purge_list`` and ``embedding_merge`` to enable signal embedding.
* A python script ``analysis/examples/embedding/embedding.py`` which illustrates the usage of the scripts.

Variables
+++++++++
* Extended the variable `useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis` to variables using daughters' pdg codes, e.g. `InvM`.
* New metavariable `useDaughterRestFrame` to calculate a variable in the rest frame of the given daughters is added.
* New variable `cosHelicityAngleForQuasiTwoBodyDecay` is added for the angular analysis on a quasi-two-body decay.
* Extended the variable `cosTPTO` to be available both in a main path and for_each loop over ROEs.

stdCharged
++++++++++
* Added working points for uniform pion-lepton fake rate.

stdPhoton and stdPi0
++++++++++++++++++++
* Added an optional parameter ``biasCorrectionTable`` to `stdPhotons` and `stdPi0s` that allows the user to specify a table name
  for the photon energy bias correction. Providing a table name will automatically apply the bias correction to all particles in
  the particle lists. This is available for all list types. The latest information on the bias correction can be found on the
  `Neutrals Performance Confluence Page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Neutrals+Performance>`_.

Modules
+++++++
* Added an option ``signalSideParticleList`` to the function :func:`modularAnalysis.variablesToNtuple` to store the index of the
  signal-side particle. This option is only valid when one calls the function in a ``for_each`` loop over the RestOfEvent. The
  branches ``__signalSideCandidate__`` and ``__nSignalSideCandidates__`` are added to the TTree by setting the option. An example
  of usage can be found in ``analysis/examples/VariableManager/variablesToNtuple.py``.
* Fixed a bug on the :b2:mod:`BestCandidateSelection` that keeps only less than the expected number of candidates when
  ``allowMultiRank=True`` and ``numBest>0``. Now the module works as documented.
* Added an option ``allowAnyParticleSource`` to the function :func:`modularAnalysis.reconstructDecayWithNeutralHadron` to let
  users apply the mother-mass constraint on a charged particle.
* The `findMCDecay` function is fixed so that all output particles have ``isSignal==1``.
  New option ``appendAllDaughters`` is added so that one can append not only the daughters described in the decay string but all
  daughters of the matched MCParticle. Another new option ``skipNonPrimaryDaughters`` is added to skip secondary particles when
  ``appendAllDaughters=True``.
* The ParticleLists labeled ``:MC``, which were created by default when the `fillParticleListFromMC` is called, are no longer
  created automatically by the function. Also, the protection that was previously applied to the list labeled ":MC" has been
  removed.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2210-devonrex
------------------------------------------------------

Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in KFit when the daughters' kinematics are updated (``daughtersUpdate=True``). The mother's momentum was calculated
  at the updated vertex position, while the updated daughters' momenta were calculated at the original position. This caused an
  inconsistency in the momentum between the mother and the sum of the daughters. Now the daughters' momenta are also calculated at
  the updated vertex position and the inconsistency is resolved.
* Changed TreeFit and KFit to be compatible with the momentum scaling factor.
  The daughters' kinematics as member variables of the Particle class are updated by being divided by the momentum scaling factor.
  However, the vertex fitters do not change the momentum scaling factor. So, the kinematics variables now return correct values.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2209-calico
----------------------------------------------------

MVA-based pi0 identification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* New function :func:`modularAnalysis.lowEnergyPi0Identification` providing MVA-based pi0 identification is added.
* Example of its usage is added as ``analysis/examples/PostMdstIdentification/LowEnergyPi0Identification.py``.

Variables
+++++++++
* Extended the variable `useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis` to variables calculated from daughters' 4-momentum, e.g.
  `cosHelicityAngleMomentum`.
* Added metavariable to retrieve the distance to the closest neighbour at a detector surface (based on track helix extrapolation):
  `minET2ETDist`.
* Added metavariable to retrieve any variable associated to the closest neighbour at a detector surface from the reference
  particle list: `minET2ETDistVar`.
* Added metavariable to retrieve the particle isolation score (based on `minET2ETDist` and, optionally, on PID detector weights):
  `minET2ETIsoScore`.

Modules
+++++++
* New modules :b2:mod:`LowEnergyPi0VetoExpert` and :b2:mod:`LowEnergyPi0IdentificationExpert` for MVA-based pi0
  identification are added.
* Added the new module :b2:mod:`ParticleMomentumUpdater` which is also available via the
  function :func:`modularAnalysis.setBeamConstrainedMomentum`. It lets you replace the momentum
  of one particle in your decay chain by p(beam)-p(selected particles).
* The module :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` has a new option to create particles which do
  not have a mdst source. It is also available via the convenience function
  :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromDummy`.
* New module :b2:mod:`KlongMomentumUpdaterExpert` to calculate and update the two-body B-meson decay including a
  Klong is added. New function :func:`modularAnalysis.updateKlongKinematicsExpert` is also added.
* In the module :b2:mod:`TagVertex` an iterative version of the KFit vertex fitter is added. This fitter should
  substitute Rave vertex fitter for the tagged B meson. The default configuration of the :b2:mod:`TagVertex` has changed.
  The default algorithm changed from ``Rave`` to ``KFit`` and the default constraint from ``IP`` to ``tube``.
  The ``KFit`` algorithm by default includes iterations, this can be changed by newly added ``kFitReqReducedChi2`` parameter.
* The new expert argument ``expertBeamConstraintPDG`` has been added to the :b2:mod:`TreeFitter`. It allows the user to constrain
  the four-momentum of a Particle to the four-momentum of the initial e+e- state.
* Updated :b2:mod:`TrackIsoCalculator` to compute the particle isolation score.

Database Objects
++++++++++++++++
* New database object class ``PIDDetectorWeights`` to store PID detector weights per standard charged particle, binned in p and
  theta.

Modular Analysis Function
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added a check to the `applyEventCuts` function to make sure that only event-based variables are used in the selection. The
  decomposition of meta variables can be tricky, so a new argument ``metavariables`` is added to extend the list of meta variables
  which should be decomposed and should themselves be ignored in the check.
* Added the argument ``treatAsInvisible`` in :func:`vertex.treeFit` to ignore particles in the fit.
* Updated the `calculateTrackIsolation` helper. Now, it returns a list of metavariables (`minET2ETDist`, `minET2ETIsoScore`,
  optionally `minET2ETDistVar` as well) correctly configured according to the helper input options. Users can then create aliases
  in their own steering script: see ``analysis/examples/VariableManager/trackIsolationVariables.py`` for an example.
* The default argument of :func:`flavorTagger.flavorTagger` is updated so that the weight files trained with MC15ri will be used as default.
  If one wants to use the previous weight files, the arguments should be set as follows: ``maskName='all'`` and ``prefix=''``.
* With the :func:`vertex.kFit`, the daughters' kinematics are updated after the vertex fit, even when fit daughters are
  selected using ``decay_string`` and ``daughtersUpdate=True``.
* The new argument ``ignoreMotherFlavor`` has been added to the function `mergeListsWithBestDuplicate`. It allows to ignore the
  flavor of the mother particle when identifying duplicates.

Particle dataobject
+++++++++++++++++++
* Added a ``replaceDaughter`` method to Particle. It allows you to replace the daughter
  of a Particle with another Particle while keeping the original order of the daughters.
  This is important to ensure the decay string will work correctly after replacing a daughter.
* Added a new Particle source ``NoMDSTSource`` to Particle. It can be used for Particles
  that do not come from any mdst source.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2207-bengal
----------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
* Added the variables of the PID probability with the calibration weights, `weightedElectronID`, `weightedMuonID`,
  `weightedPionID`, `weightedKaonID`, `weightedProtonID`, and `weightedDeuteronID`.
  Also, the expert PID variables were added, `pidWeightedLogLikelihoodValueExpert`, `pidWeightedPairProbabilityExpert`,
  and `pidWeightedProbabilityExpert`.
* Added the variable `hasCorrectROECombination` to check if the correct combination of the particle that is the basis of
  the ROE object and the particle that is loaded from the ROE.
* Added the variable `nMCDaughters` which returns the number of daughters of the MC-matched MCParticle or a MCParticle
  obtained with e.g. the `genUpsilon4S` metavariable.

Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in the :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`. The relationship of the pdg code between the loaded
  particle and the source particle was inconsistent when the loaded particle was not a self-conjugated particle.
