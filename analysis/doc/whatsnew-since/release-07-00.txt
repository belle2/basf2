Changes in the analysis package
-------------------------------

TreeFitter
++++++++++

* Added the argument ``treatAsInvisible`` to ignore particles in the fit. 


Modules
+++++++

* Added the new module :b2:mod:`ParticleMomentumUpdater` which is also available via the
  function :func:`modularAnalysis.setBeamConstrainedMomentum`. It lets you replace the momentum
  of one particle in your decay chain by p(beam)-p(selected particles).

* The module :b2:mod:`ParticleLoaderModule` has a new option to create particles which do
  not have a mdst source. It is also available via the convenience function 
  :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromDummy`.


Dataobjects
+++++++++++

* Added a ``replaceDaughter`` method to Particle. It allows you to replace the daughter
  of a Particle with another Particle while keeping the original order of the daughters.
  This is important to ensure the decay string will work correctly after replacing a daughter.

* Added a new Particle source ``NoMDSTSource`` to Particle. It can be used for Particles 
  that do not come from any mdst source.
