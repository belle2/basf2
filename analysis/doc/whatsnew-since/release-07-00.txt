Changes in the analysis package in light-2209-calico
----------------------------------------------------

MVA-based pi0 identification
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * New function :func:`modularAnalysis.lowEnergyPi0Identification` providing MVA-based pi0 identification is added.
 * Example of its usage is added as ``analysis/examples/PostMdstIdentification/LowEnergyPi0Identification.py``.

Variables
+++++++++
 * Extended the variable `useAlternativeDaughterHypothesis` to variables calculated from daughters' 4-momentum, e.g.
   `cosHelicityAngleMomentum`.

Modules
+++++++
 * New modules :b2:mod:`LowEnergyPi0VetoExpert` and :b2:mod:`LowEnergyPi0IdentificationExpert` for MVA-based pi0
   identification are added.
 * Added the new module :b2:mod:`ParticleMomentumUpdater` which is also available via the
   function :func:`modularAnalysis.setBeamConstrainedMomentum`. It lets you replace the momentum
   of one particle in your decay chain by p(beam)-p(selected particles).
 * The module :b2:mod:`ParticleLoader` has a new option to create particles which do
   not have a mdst source. It is also available via the convenience function 
   :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromDummy`.

Modular Analysis Function
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * Added a check to the `applyEventCuts` function to make sure that only event-based variables are used in the
   selection. The decomposition of meta variables can be tricky, so a new argument ``metavariables`` is added to extend
   the list of meta variables which should be decomposed and should themselves be ignored in the check.
 * Added the argument ``treatAsInvisible`` in :func:`vertex.treeFit` to ignore particles in the fit. 

Particle dataobject
+++++++++++++++++++
 * Added a ``replaceDaughter`` method to Particle. It allows you to replace the daughter
   of a Particle with another Particle while keeping the original order of the daughters.
   This is important to ensure the decay string will work correctly after replacing a daughter.
 * Added a new Particle source ``NoMDSTSource`` to Particle. It can be used for Particles 
   that do not come from any mdst source.


Changes in the analysis package in light-2207-bengal
----------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
 * Added the variables of the PID probability with the calibration weights, `weightedElectronID`, `weightedMuonID`,
   `weightedPionID`, `weightedKaonID`, `weightedProtonID`, and `weightedDeuteronID`.
   Also, the expert PID variables were added, `pidWeightedLogLikelihoodValueExpert`, `pidWeightedPairProbabilityExpert`,
   and `pidWeightedProbabilityExpert`.
 * Added the variable `hasCorrectROECombination` to check if the correct combination of the particle that is the basis of
   the ROE object and the particle that is loaded from the ROE.

Modules
+++++++
 * Fixed a bug in the :func:`modularAnalysis.fillParticleListFromROE`. The relationship of the pdg code between the loaded
   particle and the source particle was inconsistent when the loaded particle was not a self-conjugated particle.
