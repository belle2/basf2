Changes in the analysis package in light-2309-munchkin
------------------------------------------------------

Photon Energy Resolution
++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added ``ECLPhotonEnergyResolution`` to analysis database objects. This module reads the relative energy resolution calculation
  results from the `Photon Energy Resolution Calibration workflow <https://gitlab.desy.de/alexander.heidelbach/photonenergyresolutioncalibration>`_
  and creates a corresponding database object. The new method `GetCovarianceMatrix3x3FromCluster` in ``ClusterUtils`` replaces the former
  calculated values if the cluster properties (:math:`E`, :math:`\phi`, :math:`\theta`) are within valid binning and leaves them unchanged otherwise.
  ``ClusterUtils`` triggers the replacement if a globaltag with a valid ``ECLPhotonEnergyResolution`` payload is present and
  without further user input.
