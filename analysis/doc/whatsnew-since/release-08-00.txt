Changes in the analysis package in light-2309-munchkin
------------------------------------------------------

Bugfix of ParticleListManipulator for particleLists loaded from KLMClusters
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Fixed a major bug in the `ParticleListManipulator` used in functions such as `copyList`, `fillParticleList` and other
  modularAnalysis functions. The bug occurred when creating a particleList from two or more types of mdst objects, for example,
  ``K_L0`` loaded from ECLClusters and KLMClusters. When a new particleList was created from original lists, mdst objects with the
  same mdst index as other mdst objects were skipped and mot added to the new particleList, even if the mdst types were different.
* This mainly impacted the ``K_L0`` or ``neutron`` particleLists, resulting in a significant drop in particles loaded from
  KLMClusters. No such impact has been observed for other types of particleLists.


FEI
+++
* Applied the mass constraint to pi0 candidates in FEI.
  Please note that the FEI calibration on MC15ri is performed without applying pi0 mass constraint and without loosening the gamma
  energy threshold, which has been implemented since light-2305-korat.
  So, either use FEI skims (recommended), or run FEI with an older release until new FEI calibration with MC16 will be available.

Photon Energy Resolution
++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added ``ECLPhotonEnergyResolution`` to analysis database objects. This module reads the relative energy resolution calculation
  results from the `Photon Energy Resolution Calibration workflow <https://gitlab.desy.de/alexander.heidelbach/photonenergyresolutioncalibration>`_
  and creates a corresponding database object. The new method ``GetCovarianceMatrix3x3FromCluster`` in ``ClusterUtils`` replaces the former
  calculated values if the cluster properties (:math:`E`, :math:`\phi`, :math:`\theta`) are within valid binning and leaves them unchanged otherwise.
  ``ClusterUtils`` triggers the replacement if a globaltag with a valid ``ECLPhotonEnergyResolution`` payload is present and
  without further user input.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added the variables `PxHER`, `PyHER`, `PzHER` and  `PxLER`, `PyLER`, `PzLER`  which are the nominal beam momenta
  derived from the ``CollisionInvariantMass``, ``CollisionBoostVector`` and ``CollisionAxisCMS`` payloads
* Added the variables `mcPxHER`, `mcPyHER`, `mcPzHER` and  `mcPxLER`, `mcPyLER`, `mcPzLER`  which are the truth
  momenta of colliding electron/positron for the event. These are available only for MC.
  For ``EvtGen`` and ``BabaYaga`` generators these variables have dummy value for MC15 or older.
