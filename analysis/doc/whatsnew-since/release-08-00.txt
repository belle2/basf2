Changes in the analysis package in light-2309-munchkin
------------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
* Added the variables `PxHER`, `PyHER`, `PzHER` and  `PxLER`, `PyLER`, `PzLER`  which are the nominal beam momenta
  derived from the ``CollisionInvariantMass``, ``CollisionBoostVector`` and ``CollisionAxisCMS`` payloads
* Added the variables `mcPxHER`, `mcPyHER`, `mcPzHER` and  `mcPxLER`, `mcPyLER`, `mcPzLER`  which are the truth
  momenta of colliding electron/positron for the event. These are available only for MC.
  For ``EvtGen`` and ``BabaYaga`` generators these variables have dummy value for MC15 or older.
