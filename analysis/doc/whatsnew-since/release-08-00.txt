Changes in the analysis package in light-2309-munchkin
------------------------------------------------------

Photon Energy Resolution
++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added ``ECLPhotonEnergyResolution`` to analysis database objects. This module reads the relative energy resolution calculation
  results from the `Photon Energy Resolution Calibration workflow <https://gitlab.desy.de/alexander.heidelbach/photonenergyresolutioncalibration>`_
  and creates a corresponding database object. The new method ``GetCovarianceMatrix3x3FromCluster`` in ``ClusterUtils`` replaces the former
  calculated values if the cluster properties (:math:`E`, :math:`\phi`, :math:`\theta`) are within valid binning and leaves them unchanged otherwise.
  ``ClusterUtils`` triggers the replacement if a globaltag with a valid ``ECLPhotonEnergyResolution`` payload is present and
  without further user input.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added the variables `PxHER`, `PyHER`, `PzHER` and  `PxLER`, `PyLER`, `PzLER`  which are the nominal beam momenta
  derived from the ``CollisionInvariantMass``, ``CollisionBoostVector`` and ``CollisionAxisCMS`` payloads
* Added the variables `mcPxHER`, `mcPyHER`, `mcPzHER` and  `mcPxLER`, `mcPyLER`, `mcPzLER`  which are the truth
  momenta of colliding electron/positron for the event. These are available only for MC.
  For ``EvtGen`` and ``BabaYaga`` generators these variables have dummy value for MC15 or older.
