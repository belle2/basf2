Changes in the analysis package in light-2408-savannah
------------------------------------------------------

Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in `MCDecayFinder`, which previously didn't find all true candidates when using the default arrow.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added track variables `d0FromIP`, `z0FromIP` and `phi0FromIP`; which return the tracking parameters of the
  point-of-closest-approach (POCA), with respect to the measured beam interaction point.
