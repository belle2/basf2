Changes in the analysis package in light-2501-betelgeuse
--------------------------------------------------------

Variables
+++++++++
* The variables `prodVertexX`, `prodVertexY`, and `prodVertexZ` now return the production vertex position also for
  TreeFit. Previously, only Rave was supported. Moreover, the covariance matrix elements of the production vertex for a
  TreeFit are now also available via the variables `prodVertexCov` and `prodVertexXErr`, etc.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2411-aldebaran
-------------------------------------------------------

K_S0 selector module
++++++++++++++++++++
* Changed the model from FastBDT to LightGBM, reoptimized hyperparameters
* Included three new input feature for LambdaVeto: ArmenterosDaughter1Qt, ArmenterosDaughter2Qt, ArmenterosLongitudinalMomentumAsymmetry. Removed PXD hits and daughter momentum as inputs.
* Retrained with MC 15rd inclusive data, uploaded new payload to conditiondb

Modular Analysis
++++++++++++++++
* Add options to `modularAnalysis.writePi0EtaVeto` to:

  * Require the soft photon being in the current RestOfEvent.
  * Add separate selections to be applied during `modularAnalysis.reconstructDecay` for both the :math:`\pi^0` as well as
    the :math:`\eta` reconstruction.

Kinematic Fitting tools
+++++++++++++++++++++++
* Added option to prepend label to OrkaKinfit variables to allow multiple fits to be performed in same path.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added variables `tSigB`, `tTagB` which represent reconstructed proper decay times of individual B mesons.
* Added `DeltaT3D` = `tSigB` - `tTagB` as an alternative to the `DeltaT` variable.
* Added the reconstructed coordinates of the Y4S vertex `Y4SvtxX`, `Y4SvtxY`, `Y4SvtxZ` and the Tag vertex
  covariance matrix `TagVCov`.
* Added `int` metavariable that can convert the floating point variables output to an integer value, 
  that can be saved correctly by `VariablesToNtuple` module into an integer branch of a TTree. 

Modules
+++++++
* Add support for storing ``FileMetaData`` to `VariablesToNtuple` module. Ntuples will now have a ``persistent``
  tree with ``FileMetaData`` branch with the relevant metadata information. 

  * Add a new option ``dataDescription`` to `VariablesToNtuple` which accepts a dictionary of key:value pairs,
    allowing users to store additional information in the ntuple metadata.
  * Add ntuple file support to ``b2file-merge``, which is now the recommended tool to merge ntuples over
    ``hadd``. ``b2file-metadata-show`` and ``b2file-metadata-add`` will also work with ntuples. 

* Added a tunable buffer to the ``VariabesToTable`` module to improve compression efficiency and feather as new output format.

Changes in the analysis package in light-2409-toyger
----------------------------------------------------

Modules
+++++++
* Added a module ``VariabesToTable`` that writes Ntuples to hdf5, csv or parquet.
* Added support for the FEI table format of the corrections repository to the analysis reweighting script

Graph Neural Network based Flavor Tagger
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* Fixed a memory leak that affected light-2406-ragdoll and light-2408-savannah by upgrading the tensorflow version

Changes in the analysis package in light-2408-savannah
------------------------------------------------------

Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in `MCDecayFinder`, which previously didn't find all true candidates when using the default arrow.
* Fixed a bug in :ref:`analysis_reweighting` where the weights were not correctly assigned 
  if a selection cut was applied on the input DataFrame.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added track variables `d0FromIP`, `z0FromIP` and `phi0FromIP`; which return the tracking parameters of the
  point-of-closest-approach (POCA), with respect to the measured beam interaction point.
* Added energy [in tau rest frame] of radiated photon from tau+/- decays: 'tauPlusEgstar'/'tauMinusEgstar'
* Added a meta variable `useMCancestorBRestFrame` which returns the given variable in the rest frame of the
  ancestor B MC particle.

Command line tools
++++++++++++++++++
* Improved output and content of the :ref:`b2help-recommendation`.
* Added new tool to list available FEI modes :ref:`b2help-print-fei-mode-names` and corresponding function `get_mode_names`.

Charm Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++++++++
* Updated the default identifier name for the payload of the Charm Flavor Tagger (argument ``uniqueIdentifier`` of the
  function ``charmFlavorTagger``) to ``CFT_ragdoll``. This value must be used for all releases as recent as
  light-2406-ragdoll and release-09.
