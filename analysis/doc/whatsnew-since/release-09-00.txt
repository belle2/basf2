Changes in the analysis package in light-2408-savannah
------------------------------------------------------

Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in `MCDecayFinder`, which previously didn't find all true candidates when using the default arrow.
* Fixed a bug in :ref:`analysis_reweighting` where the weights were not correctly assigned 
  if a selection cut was applied on the input DataFrame. 

Variables
+++++++++
* Added track variables `d0FromIP`, `z0FromIP` and `phi0FromIP`; which return the tracking parameters of the
  point-of-closest-approach (POCA), with respect to the measured beam interaction point.
* Added energy [in tau rest frame] of radiated photon from tau+/- decays: 'tauPlusEgstar'/'tauMinusEgstar'

Command line tools
++++++++++++++++++
* Improved output and content of the :ref:`b2help-recommendation`.
