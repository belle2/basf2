Changes in the analysis package in light-2408-savannah
------------------------------------------------------

Modules
+++++++
* Fixed a bug in `MCDecayFinder`, which previously didn't find all true candidates when using the default arrow.
* Fixed a bug in :ref:`analysis_reweighting` where the weights were not correctly assigned 
  if a selection cut was applied on the input DataFrame. 
* Added a module ``VariabesToTable`` that writes Ntuples to hdf5, csv or parquet.

Variables
+++++++++
* Added track variables `d0FromIP`, `z0FromIP` and `phi0FromIP`; which return the tracking parameters of the
  point-of-closest-approach (POCA), with respect to the measured beam interaction point.
* Added energy [in tau rest frame] of radiated photon from tau+/- decays: 'tauPlusEgstar'/'tauMinusEgstar'
* Added a meta variable `useMCancestorBRestFrame` which returns the given variable in the rest frame of the
  ancestor B MC particle.

Command line tools
++++++++++++++++++
* Improved output and content of the :ref:`b2help-recommendation`.
* Added new tool to list available FEI modes :ref:`b2help-print-fei-mode-names` and corresponding function `get_mode_names`.

Charm Flavor Tagger
+++++++++++++++++++
* Updated the default identifier name for the payload of the Charm Flavor Tagger (argument ``uniqueIdentifier`` of the
  function ``charmFlavorTagger``) to ``CFT_ragdoll``. This value must be used for all releases as recent as
  light-2406-ragdoll and release-09.
