Changes in the analysis package in light-2507-europa
----------------------------------------------------

stdCharged
++++++++++
* Removed the selection on `nCDCHits` to match the recommendation for release-08 samples.

FlavorTagger
++++++++++++
* Refactored flavor tagging scripts, which for analysts however only means that now the flavor tagging variables are
  available via the collection ``flavor_tagging`` and not via ``flavorTagger.flavor_tagging``.
