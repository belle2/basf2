# isSignalAcceptFlags or isSignalAcceptSomething, means a special isSignal variable that accepts certain
# bits in the mcErrors to be set. For example, the pure isSignal equals to 1 only when mcErrors == 0, while
# isSignalAcceptMissingGamma equals to 1 when mcErrors == 0 or mcErrors == 16, which could be interpreted
# as "After setting the MissGamma bit (the 5th bit, or 16 = 0b00010000) to 0, if mcErrors == 0, then
# isSignalAcceptMissingGamma equals to 1". A new isSignalAcceptSomething variables could be added conveniently
# by create_isSignal_alias() in variable.utils:
# >>> c_MissGamma = 16
# >>> c_DecayInFlight = 4
# >>> vu.create_isSignal_alias("isSignalAcceptMissingGammaAndDecayInFlight", [c_MissGamma, c_DecayInFlight])
#
#
# if you want to know the detail of create_isSignal_alias(), you could read the paragraph below then check the code
# in analysis/scripts/variables/utils.py
# The operation, setting certain bits in a variable to 0, is called "unmask", in contrast to "mask".
# The function create_isSignal_alias() adds new isSignalAcceptSomething variable by unmasking the mcErrors
# code using the meta function unmask() like:
# >>> c_MissGamma = 16
# >>> c_DecayInFlight = 4
# >>> c_Correct = 0
# >>> vm.addAlias("isSignalAcceptMissingGammaAndDecayInFlight", "passesCut(unmask(mcErrors," +
# ...             "%d) == %d)" % (c_MissGamma | c_DecayInFlight, c_Correct))
# The full definition of mc match error flags could be found in:
# https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/analysis/doc/MCMatching.html#error-flags
