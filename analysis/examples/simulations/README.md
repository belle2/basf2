Here are collected examples of simulation scripts for MC. Simulations means
generation of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events. In Belle 2, MC simulation is
normally held by the experts, so these scripts were removed from tutorials but
stored as examples. If you are starting your analysis and want to generate some
MC privately, please think twice: MC can already be requested by someone else
before and you need to understand how to configure the software to get correct
MC.
