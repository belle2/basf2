# Simulation

Here are collected examples of simulation scripts for MC. Simulation means
generation of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events. In Belle II, MC simulation
is normally run by the experts, so these scripts were removed from tutorials
but stored as examples. If you are starting your analysis and want to
generate some MC privately, please think twice: MC can have already been
requested by someone else before and you need to understand how to configure
the software to get correct MC.
