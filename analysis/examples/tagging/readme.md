# Tagging

Upsilon4S decays into two B mesons. The kinematics of the Upsilon4S are well
known (by using the energies/momenta of the electron and positron), so by
reconstructing one of the two B mesons, we can infer the kinematics of the
other. Therefore, one often reconstructs one of the B mesons in a well
understood channel (called the tag B) and uses it to constrain the properties
of the other B (the signal B), which is reconstructed in a more interesting
channel.

A very powerful way to tag your event (i.e. reconstruct a tag B) is with the
use of the Full Event Interpretation (FEI).
