# This tutorial demonstrates how to reconstruct the
# following  decay chain:
#
# B0 -> rho gamma
#       |
#       +-> pi+ pi-
#
# and construct pi0/eta veto for the signal photon. In this
# example the pi0 veto is constructed in the following
# way:
# - for each B0 -> rho gamma candidate
#     i) combine photon (gamma) used in the reconstruction
#        of the B0 candidate with all other soft photons defined
#        in analysis/scripts/modularAnalysis.py
#    ii) find pi0/eta candidate with highest pi0/eta probability
#   iii) write value of pi0/eta probability
#
# Note: This example uses the signal MC sample created in
# MC campaign 5.0, therefore it can be ran only on KEKCC computers.

# In this section, I show how to use the writePi0EtaVeto.
#
# Before using the pi0/eta veto you need at least the default weight files: pi0veto.root and etaveto.root.
# downloadFlag parameter is set to True by default,
# the default weight files are downloaded to your workingDirectory automatically from the database in that case.
# You can also download them from my home directory:
# scp -r /home/belle2/otakyo/pi0etaveto
# into your workingDirectory/.
# The default workingDirectory is '.'

# perform pi0/eta veto
writePi0EtaVeto('B0', 'B0 -> rho0 ^gamma', workingDirectory='pi0etaveto')

# at this stage the B0 candidates should have
# extraInfo(Pi0_Prob) and extraInfo(Eta_Prob) value attached.
# extraInfo(Pi0_Prob) means pi0 probability for the B0 candidates whose gamma daughter
# extraInfo(Eta_Prob) means eta probability for the B0 candidates whose gamma daughter
# For the B0 candidates whose gamma daughter could not be combined with
# any of the remaining photons to form pi0/eta because of soft photon selection
# the extraInfo(Pi0_Prob) and extraInfo(Eta_Prob) does not exist. In these cases
# -999 will be written to the extraInfo(Pi0_Prob) branch and extraInfo(Eta_Prob) branch

# You might apply writePi0EtaVeto in one process several times.
# Please be careful in that case.
# You have to set pi0softname and etasoftname parameters to your original names except for default
# from the second application for debug. For example,
# writePi0EtaVeto('B0', 'B0 -> rho0 ^gamma',pi0softname='PI0SOFT_type2',etasoftname='ETASOFT_type2')
# Please note that this is not enough if you apply this function more than once
# regarding same particleList in one process,
# you have to set not only pi0softname and etasoftname parameters
# but also pi0vetoname and etavetoname parameters to your original names except for default
# from the second application for debug. For example,
# writePi0EtaVeto('B0', 'B0 -> rho0 ^gamma',
# pi0softname='PI0SOFT_type2',etasoftname='ETASOFT_type2',pi0vetoname='Pi0_Prob2',etavetoname='Eta_Prob2')

# If you train by yourself, you should refer to
# B2A701-ContinuumSuppression_Input.py
# B2A702-ContinuumSuppression_MVATrain.py


# You can also do a simple veto using delta mass ranking as below.

# VETO starts here
# ----------------

# Create a new path (called ROE path) which will be executed for
# each ROE in an event.
# Note that ROE exists for each B0 candidate, so when we loop
# over each ROE, we effectively loop over signal B0 candidates

roe_path = create_path()

# The ROE objects might in general be related to Particle from multiple
# particle lists therfore we need to check if the current ROE object
# is related to the Particle from our signal decay. If it is not
# the execution of roe_path will be finished (by starting empty,
# dead end path). Note that in this example this x-check is not
# neccessary, but is anyway added for sake of completness
deadEndPath = create_path()

# Note again: all actions (modules) included in roe_path will be
# executed for each ROE in the event
# First we check that the current ROE is related to B0 candidate
signalSideParticleFilter('B0', '', roe_path, deadEndPath)

# create and fill gamma ParticleList that will contain
# all photons found in ROE (not used to reconstruct current B0 candidate)
# The photons need to have energy above 50 MeV to be considered
# (one can add any cut)
fillParticleList('gamma:roe', 'isInRestOfEvent == 1 and E > 0.050', path=roe_path)

# in order to be able to use modularAnalysis functions (reconstructDecay in particular)
# we need a ParticleList containg the photon candidate used to reconstruct the
# current B meson as well
# The DecayString is used to specify the selected particle (^)
fillSignalSideParticleList('gamma:sig', 'B0 -> rho0 ^gamma', roe_path)

# make combinations of signal photon candidates with all photons from ROE
# keep only combinations in given invariant mass range
reconstructDecay('pi0:veto -> gamma:sig gamma:roe', '0.080 < M < 0.200', path=roe_path)

# at this point one could use all features provided by the analysis software
# to make the veto as effective as possible. For example, one can perform truth
# matching, training/applying TMVA classifier, save pi0 candidates with ntuple
# maker for offline analysis/study.

# in this example the variable, which is used to veto pi0 is very simple:
# invariant mass of pi0 that is closest to the pi0's nominal mass
# Therfore, we just simply rank pi0 candidates according to their distance
# from nominal mass (dM variable) and keep only the best candidate
rankByLowest('pi0:veto', 'abs(dM)', 1, path=roe_path)

# write the invariant mass of the best pi0 candidate to the current B0
# candidate as the 'pi0veto' extraInfo
variableToSignalSideExtraInfo('pi0:veto', {'M': 'pi0veto'}, path=roe_path)

# execute roe_path for each RestOfEvent in the event
analysis_main.for_each('RestOfEvent', 'RestOfEvents', roe_path)

# VETO ends here
# ----------------

# we're now out of the ROE path
# at this stage the B0 candidates should have
# extraInfo(pi0veto) value attached. For the B0
# candidates whose gamma daughter could not be combined with
# any of the remaining photons to form pi0 within given mass
# range the extraInfo(pi0veto) does not exist. In these cases
# -999 will be written to the extraInfo(pi0veto) branch
