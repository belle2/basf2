#     i) combine photon (gamma) used in the reconstruction               #
#        of the B0 candidate with all other soft photons defined         #
#        in analysis/scripts/modularAnalysis.py                          #
#    ii) find pi0/eta candidate with highest pi0/eta probability         #
#   iii) write value of pi0/eta probability                              #
#                                                                        #

# dead end path). Note that in this example this x-check is not
# necessary, but is anyway added for sake of completeness

# at this point one could use all features provided by the analysis software

# matching, training/applying TMVA classifier, save pi0 candidates with ntuple
# maker for offline analysis/study.

# in this example the variable, which is used to veto pi0 is very simple:
# invariant mass of pi0 that is closest to the pi0's nominal mass
# Therefore, we just simply rank pi0 candidates according to their distance
# from nominal mass (dM variable) and keep only the best candidate
