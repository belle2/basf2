# This file describes the inverseSamplingRate feature
# and howto normalise event weights using TMVA
#
#######################################################
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to perform a more advanced
# TMVA training on electron candidates:
#   - Use sampling to reduce the amount of stored background candidates without changing the signal fraction
#   - Set an upper boundary for the maximum amount of candidates
#   - Use TMVA's NormMode to normalise the signal and background weights
#
# The standard TMVA method FastBDT is used to perform the training.
#
# Afterwards the training is applied using the TMVAExpert, some advanced features are shown
#   - Transform the output of a classifier to a probability (which is done as default anyway)
#   - Set another signal fraction which differs from the training sample
#   - Set the signal class id, which is necessary if the signal class is not 1
#
# Note: This example uses the generic MC sample created in
# MC campaign 3.5, therefore it can be ran only on KEKCC computers.
