# This tutorial demonstrates how to use the extern Teacher on data produced
# by the VariablesToNtuple module and NtupleTools module.
# The inverseSamplingRate and onTheFly feature is obviously not available,
# and there are other obstacles.
#
# But if you already have the data in the corresponding format, it sometimes
# is easier to use the output of the NtupleTools directly instead of
# writing out everything again using the TMVATeacher.
#
# Note: This example uses the generic MC sample created in
# MC campaign 3.5, therefore it can be ran only on KEKCC computers.
