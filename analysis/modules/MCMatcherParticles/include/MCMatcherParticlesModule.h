  /**
   * MC matching module: module performs MC matching (sets the relation Particle -> MCParticle) for all particles
   * and its (grand)^N-daughter particles in the user-specified ParticleList. The MC matching algorithm is implemented
   * in the MCMatching namespace.
   *
   * In addition to the usual mc matching algorithm the module can run also loose mc matching. The difference between
   * loose and normal mc matching algorithm is that the loose algorithm will find the common mother of the majority of
   * daughter particles while the normal algorithm finds the common mother of all daughters. In the case one of the
   * daughters has no generated mother (or mc association) the normal mc matching algorithm will tag such candidate
   * as background (no mc match), while the loose algorithm will find the common mother of remaining daughters. This
   * is useful for identifying for example self cross-feed candidates, where usually one of the photons is wrong,
   * but the rest of the decay chain is correctly reconstructed. The results of loose mc matching algorithm are
   * stored to the following extraInfo items:
   * - looseMCMotherPDG: PDG code of most common mother
   * - looseMCMotherIndex: 1-based StoreArray<MCParticle> index of most common mother
   * - looseMCWrongDaughterN: number of daughters that don't originate from the most
   *                          common mother
   * - looseMCWrongDaughterPDG: PDG code of the daughter that doesn't originate from
   *                            the most common mother
   *                            (only if looseMCWrongDaughterN = 1)
   * - looseMCWrongDaughterBiB: 1 if the wrong daughter is Beam Induced Background
   *                            Particle
