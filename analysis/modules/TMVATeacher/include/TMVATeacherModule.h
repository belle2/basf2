  /**
   * This modules writes out the necessary training data for a TMVA training.
   * TMVA methods can be trained using the externTeacher tool using this data.
   *
   * The samples are constructed using by calculating given variables for each candidate
   * in the given particleLists. If no particleLists are given an event-based training is assumed.
   * On sample per event is calculated in this case.
   *
   * It is possible to provide a sample variable and write out only every n-th sample of a specific class, the weight of each sample is increased accordingly.
   * Furthermore it is possible to restrict the amount of samples to an upper boundary, the weight of each sample is NOT changed in this case.
   *
   * If you run several basf2 instances on a cluster, you can just merge the resulting
   * *.root files using hadd or the fei_merge_files tool.
   *
   * If you run only one instance of basf2, you can also train "on-the-fly" at the end of data taking,
   * without invoking the externTeacher tool, using the TMVAOnTheFlyTeacher.
   *
   * You can apply a trained TMVAMethod with the TMVAExpertModule and calculate the SignalProbability for the Particles in a ParticleList.
