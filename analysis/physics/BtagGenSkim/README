This is a package for the B-tag SKIM on the generator level for B anti-B meson pairs. 

This package can be used for several reasons. You can check already studied decays, 
check if the MC generation is OK (if Br are correct), these files can also help 
find potential decay channels of future interest that have not yet been considered, etc.

USAGE:

1. GENERATION (BS10*)

Change the decay mode of the B-sig, if you are interested in a different decay mode. Run these scripts for mdst data generation: 
   - "basf2 BS101-BBChargedGen.py 1000 output.root" for generating 1000 pairs of charged BB events into output.root file.
   - "basf2 BS102-BBNeutralGen.py 1000 output.root" for generating 1000 pairs of neutral BB events into output.root file.

1. PRINTOUT (BS201*)

Here you can verify the decay chain:
   - "basf2 BS201-PrintOutMCParticles.py input.root -n 10" for printing out decay trees for the first 10 events in the input.root file.

2. SKIM (BS30*)

Run these scripts for skimming the original mdst data. This produces a new mdst file, which contains only relevant events.
   - "basf2 BS301-SkimMdstCharged.py input.root output.root 1" for reconstruction of ALL included decay modes of charged BB pairs (for shorter version run "basf2 BS301-SkimMdstCharged.py 0")
   - "basf2 BS302-SkimMdstNeutral.py input.root output.root 1" for reconstruction of ALL included decay modes of neutral BB pairs (for shorter version run "basf2 BS302-SkimMdstNeutral.py 0")
