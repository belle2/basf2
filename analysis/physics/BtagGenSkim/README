This is a package for the B-tag SKIM on the generator level for B anti-B meson pairs. 

This package can be used for several reasons. You can check already studied decays, 
check if the MC generation is OK (if Br are correct), these files can also help 
find potential decay channels of future interest that have not yet been considered, etc.

USAGE:

1. RUN ONE SKIM JOB (Btag-SkimMdst.py)
   Provide an input file and output file name for skimming the data. Provide the 0/1 choice for reconstructing all or only most frequent decay modes
   - basf2 Btag-SkimMdst.py input.root output.root 1


2. RUN MULTIPLE SKIM JOBS (Btag-SkimMdst.py)
   Provide an input directory for skimming the data. Skimmed files are produced in a new rootFiles/ directory. Provide the 0/1 choice for reconstructing all or only most frequent decay modes
   - basf2 Btag-SkimMdstJobs.py inputDir 1
