simple: 

This is an example on how to submit multiple jobs at once, if the number of jobs you wish to submit is rather large.
The main python steering file is "JS101-SteeringFile-simple.py", which generates 100 events with a generic decay of Upsilon(4S) and 
then saves the output into the rootFiles/ folder. This steering file also needs a number argument for the output file name:

e.g.:
"basf2 JS101-SteeringFile-simple.py 3"     # runs the script and produces the file rootFiles/JS101-EvtGenData_3.root

However, if you wish to run this script for example 5000 times, it is unpractical to manually run it 5000 times.
The second file with the name "JS201-JobSubmissionScript-simple.py" uses loops to create a command string, which is then 
printed out in the terminal and evaluated. A log directory is also created. This file also works with the "python"
command instead of "basf2".

e.g.:
"python JS201-JobSubmissionScript-simple.py"

These files also provide examples for:
      - automatic folder and subfolder creation
      - the use of arguments when running the python steering files with basf2.

generic MC data:

The main python steering file is "JS101-SteeringFile.py", which loads 100 files (300-399) of a specific mcType (charged/mixed/..), 
specific background (BGx0/BGx1), specific stream (s00-s49). This steering file needs several arguments:

e.g.:
"basf2 JS101-SteeringFile.py charged BGx0 s12 3"     # loads files 300-399 from stream s12 with no background and of the charged type

However, if you wish to run this script for example through all the streams and files, use the file "JS201-JobSubmissionScript.py" where you provide only mcType and background.

e.g.:
"python JS201-JobSubmissionScript.py charged BGx0"
