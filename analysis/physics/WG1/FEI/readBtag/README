To run this script you have to do the following:

0. Have BASF2 installed and ready to run

1. Copy an existing FEI training somewhere to your home directory
 - the existing trainings can be found at https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Physics+SLMissing
 - for example: https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Physics+GenericFEIResults

2. Open readBtag-FEI.py script and set the location of the fei_path.pickle file
 - modify the following parameter in readBtag-FEI.py: fei_pickle = '' 
   do that it points to the fei_path.pickle file found in the FEI directory
   that you have copied in step 1

3. Test that everything works fine by executing the script over a small sample
 - note that you have to execute basf2 from the FEI directory that you have copied in step 1
 - run for example: basf2 /path_to_your_readBtag_script/readBtag-FEI.py test.root 0 10 /ghi/fs01/belle2/bdata/MC/fab/sim/release-00-05-03/DBxxxxxxxx/MC5/prod00000001/s00/e0001/4S/r00001/mixed/sub00 -l ERROR -n 100

4. The script produces the flat ntuples containing Btag candidates reconstructed hadronicaly and semileptonicaly
 - the content of the ntuples is described at https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Physics+ReadBtagMonitoringOutput
