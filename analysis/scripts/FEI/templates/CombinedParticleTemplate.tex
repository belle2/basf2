\cprotect\section{Particle: ${particleName}}
In the reconstruction of ${particleName} ${NUsedChannels} channels out of ${NChannels} possible channels were used.
\begin{itemize}
    ${channelListAsItems}
\end{itemize}
This amounts to ${particleNSignal} signal events and ${particleNBackground} background events in total before cuts.
Channel-specific pre-cuts and a particle-specific post cut on the signal probability of the particle were applied.
After all cuts ${particleNSignalAfterPostCut} signal events and ${particleNBackgroundAfterPostCut} background events remained.
