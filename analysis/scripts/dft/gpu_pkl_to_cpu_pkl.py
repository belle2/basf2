"""
Converts a pickle file containing CudaNdarraySharedVariables into
a pickle file containing only TensorSharedVariables.

Usage:

gpu_pkl_to_cpu_pkl.py <gpu.pkl> <cpu.pkl>

Loads gpu.pkl, replaces cuda shared variables with numpy ones,
and saves to cpu.pkl.

If you create a model while using GPU and later want to unpickle it
on a machine without a GPU, you must convert it this way.

This is theano's fault, not pylearn2's. I would like to fix theano,
but don't understand the innards of theano well enough, and none of
the theano developers has been willing to help me at all with this
issue. If it annoys you that you have to do this, please help me
persuade the theano developers that this issue is worth more of their
attention.

Note: This script is also useful if you want to create a model on GPU,
save it, and then run other theano functionality on CPU later, even
if your machine has a GPU. It could be useful to modify this script
to do the reverse conversion, so you can create a model on CPU, save
it, and then run theano functions on GPU later.

Further note: this script is very hacky and imprecise. It is likely
to do things like blow away subclasses of list and dict and turn them
into plain lists and dicts. It is also liable to overlook all sorts of
theano shared variables if you have an exotic data structure stored in
the pickle. You probably want to test that the cpu pickle file can be
loaded on a machine without GPU to be sure that the script actually
found them all.
