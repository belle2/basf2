\section{Particle: ${particleName}}
In the reconstruction of ${particleName} ${NUsedChannels} out of ${NChannels} possible channels were used.
\begin{itemize}
    ${channelListAsItems}
\end{itemize}
This amounts to \num{${particleNSignal}} signal events and \num{${particleNBackground}} background events in total before cuts.
Channel-specific pre-cuts and a particle-specific post cut on the signal probability of the particle were applied.
After all cuts \num{${particleNSignalAfterPostCut}} signal events and \num{${particleNBackgroundAfterPostCut}} background events remained.
