Variable \emph{${preCutVariable}} for combinations of daughter candidates of this channel.
The PreCut range $$ ${preCutRange} $$ for this channel is marked with vertical lines in the plots above.
The PreCuts were determined on variable \emph{${preCutVariable}} with a desired total signal efficiency of ${preCutEfficiency}.
For this channel only the efficiency is ${channelEfficiencyAfterPreCut} with a purity of ${channelPurityAfterPreCut}, corresponding to
${channelNSignalAfterPreCut} signal and ${channelNBackgroundAfterPreCut} background events.
