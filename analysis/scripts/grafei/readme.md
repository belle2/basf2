# Graph-based Full Event Interpretation

This folder contains the implementation of the **Graph-based Full Event Interpretation** (graFEI), a machine learning tool based on Graph Neural Networks to inclusively reconstruct events in Belle II using information on the final state particles only, without any prior assumptions about the structure of the underlying decay chain.

More information is available on the dedicated [Sphinx page](https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/analysis/doc/GraFEI.html). 

The work is documented in [these proceedings](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1106990/papers/4996235/files/12252-ACAT_2022_proceedings.pdf) and is based on [_Learning tree structures from leaves for particle decay reconstruction_](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ac8de0) by Kahn et al. Please consider citing both papers. 
Part of the code is adapted from the work of Kahn et al (available [here](https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/BaumBauen)).
