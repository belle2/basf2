# Graph-based Full Event Interpretation

This folder contains the implementation of the **Graph-based Full Event Interpretation** (graFEI), a machine learning tool to inclusively reconstruct 
events in Belle II using information on the final state particles only, without any prior assumption about the structure of the underlying decay chain.
This task is achieved with the use of Graph Neural Networks.

More information is available in the dedicated [Sphinx page](https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/analysis/doc/GraFEI.html). 

This work is based on [_Learning tree structures from leaves for particle decay reconstruction_](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/ac8de0) by Kahn et al. The code is adapted from the work of the authors (available [here](https://github.com/Helmholtz-AI-Energy/BaumBauen)).
