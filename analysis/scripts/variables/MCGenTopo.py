def mc_gen_topo(n=200):
    """
    Gets the list of variables containing the raw topology information of MC generated events.

    To be specific, the list including the following variables:
        nMCGen (number of MC generated particles in a given event),
        MCGenPDG_i (PDG code of the ith MC generated particle in a given event), i=0, 1, ... n-2, n-1,
        MCGenMothIndex_i (mother index of the ith MC generated particle in a given event), i=0, 1, ... n-2, n-1.
    Here, nMCGen, MCGenPDG_i and MCGenMothIndex_i are just aliases of nMCParticles, genParticle(i, varForMCGen(PDG))
    and genParticle(i, varForMCGen(mcMother(mdstIndex))), respectively.
    For more details, please refer to the documentation strings of nMCParticles, genParticle, varForMCGen, PDG,
    mcMother, and mdstIndex.

    Note that the function has a parameter that specifies the number of MCGenPDG_i/MCGenMothIndex_i variables.
    To completely examine the topology information of the events in an MC sample,
    the parameter should be greater than or equal to the maximum of nMCGen in the sample.
    Normally, the maximum of nMCGen in the MC samples at Belle II is less than 200.
    Hence, if you have no idea about the maximum of nMCGen in your own MC sample,
    it is usually a safe choice to use the default parameter value 200.
    However, an overlarge parameter value leads to unncessary waste of disk space and redundant variables with inelegant NaN values.
    Hence, if you know the maximum of nMCGen in your own MC sample, it is a better choice to assign the parameter a proper value.

    Parameters:
        n (int): number of MCGenPDG_i/MCGenMothIndex_i variables.
