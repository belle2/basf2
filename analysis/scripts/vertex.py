        The performance of TreeFit with these particles is not guaranteed.
        Alternatively, one can perform the TreeFit ignoring these particles from the vertex fit with

            The value of 0 rejects the particle candidates with failed fit.
        massConstraint (list(int) or list(str)): list of PDG ids or Names of the particles which are mass-constrained
            Please do not mix PDG id and particle names in massConstraint list.
        ipConstraint (bool): constrain head production vertex to IP (x-y-z) constraint
        customOriginConstraint (bool): use a custom origin vertex as the production vertex of your particle.
            This is useful when fitting D*/D without wanting to fit a B but constraining the process to be B-decay-like.
            (think of semileptonic modes and stuff with a neutrino in the B decay).
        customOriginVertex (list(float)): 3d vector of the vertex coordinates you want to use as custom origin.
            Default numbers are taken for B-mesons
        customOriginCovariance (list(float)): 3x3 covariance matrix for the custom vertex (type: vector).
            Default numbers extracted from generator distribution width of B-mesons.
        updateAllDaughters (bool): if true the entire tree will be updated with the fitted values
            for momenta and vertex position. Otherwise only the momenta of the head of the tree will be updated,
            however for all daughters we also update the vertex position with the fit results as this would
            otherwise be set to {0, 0, 0} contact us if this causes any hardship/confusion.
        originDimension (int): If the origin or IP constraint (``customOriginVertex`` or ``ipConstraint``) are used,
            this specifies the dimension of the constraint (3D or 2D).
        treatAsInvisible (str): Decay string to select one particle that will be treated as invisible in the fit.
        ignoreFromVertexFit (str): Decay string to select particles that will be ignored to determine the vertex position.
