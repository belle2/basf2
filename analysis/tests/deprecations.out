[INFO] Steering file: analysis/tests/deprecations.py
[INFO] The random number seed is set to "1337"
Use of analysis_main is deprecated, please update your scripts.
You should now create a basf2.Path, and add modules there. If you are
using modularAnalysis convenience functions, you should pass it into them.

If your code looked something like:

   from basf2 import *
   from modularAnalysis import doSomething
   doSomething()
   process(analysis_main)

please replace it with your own path:

   import basf2
   from modularAnalysis import doSomething
   mypath = basf2.Path() # create your own path (call it what you like)
   doSomething(path=mypath)
   basf2.process(mypath)

For more hints, check the documentation
