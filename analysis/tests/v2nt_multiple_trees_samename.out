You probably want to either set the output fileName or the treeName to something else:

   from modularAnalysis import variablesToNtuple
   variablesToNtuple('pi+:all', ['p'], treename='pions')
   variablesToNtuple('gamma:all', ['p'], treename='photons') # two trees, same file

 == Or ==
   from modularAnalysis import variablesToNtuple
   variablesToNtuple('pi+:all', ['p'], filename='pions.root')
   variablesToNtuple('gamma:all', ['p'], filename='photons.root') # two files
