\section{Introduction}
This document contains results of validation study made for samples of simulated $B^+\to\rho^0K^{*+}(\to K^+\pi^0)$\ decays with Longitudinal and Transverse polarisations. 
For this study events from the simulated samples were reconstructed and underwent some loose selection summarized in Table~\ref{tab:Selection}.
Numbers of generated, reconstructed and selected events, as well as essiciency of these steps together with fraction of self cross-feed canddiates for both samples is presented in Table~\ref{tab:Summary} with detailed efficienies of different steps of the selection in Table~\ref{tab:EffDetailed}. Some distributions of variables commonly used in such analyses are presented in Section~\ref{sec:Vars}. Resolution of angular analysis variables are presented in Section~\ref{sec:Res} and correlations between those variables are studied in Sections~\ref{sec:GCorr} and ~\ref{sec:RCorr}.
