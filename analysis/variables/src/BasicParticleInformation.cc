Store array index (0 - based) of the MDST object from which the Particle was created.

    It is not a unique identifier of particle. For example, a pion and a gamma can have the same `mdstIndex`:
    pions are created from tracks whereas gammas are created from ECL clusters; tracks and
    ECL clusters are stored in different arrays. A photon may be created from ECL cluster with index 0 and a
    pion may be created from track with index 0 will both have :b2:var:`mdstIndex` equal to 0, but they will be different particles.

.. tip:: 
    Two particles of the same type can also have the same :b2:var:`mdstIndex`. This would mean that they are created from the same object. 
    For example, if pion and kaon have the same :b2:var:`mdstIndex` it means that they are created from the same track.

    If you are looking for unique identifier of the particle, please use :b2:var:`uniqueParticleIdentifier`.

A context-dependent :math:`\chi^2` probability for 'the fit' related to this particle.
