####  Data for Database (ARICHDatabaseImporter.py)

All data can be found at: https://stash.desy.de/projects/B2G/repos/arich_database
Data for classes: ARICHAerogelInfo, ARICHAsicInfo, ARICHFebTest, ARICHHapdQA, ARICHHapdQE, ARICHHapdInfo

#### Importing and exporting data to/from DB

For each class there are functions "importClass" and "exportClass".
Data can be saved in local database and central database (PNNL: http://belle2db.hep.pnnl.gov/ui/index.html?).


#### Exporting data from CENTRAL DB

1.) Central (Conditions) DB: http://belle2db.hep.pnnl.gov/ui/index.html?
2.) To get the data, use steering file ARICHDatabaseImporter_export.py in arich/examples
3.) There is a command use_central_database() at the top of the steering file:
- You can choose whether you want to access data from global tag “ARICH” or “test_ARICHReconstruction” 
- At the bottom of the steering file there are different functions that export data:
	- Uncomment what data you want to get
	- For now, you can use: dbImporter.exportAerogelInfo(), dbImporter.exportHapdQE(), dbImporter.exportHapdQA(), dbImporter.exportBadChannels(), dbImporter.exportHapdInfo()
4.) Export functions:
- They can be found in ARICHDatabaseImporter.cc in arich/calibration
- They get elements of TClonesArray (dbobjects)
- Functions loop over elements
- They print some parameters using getters from dbobjects:
	- This can be changed for usage in other modules
	- Two functions are simple examples of usage of data from the DB:
		- getBiasVoltagesForHapdChip(std::string serialNumber): Function that calculates bias voltage at gain = 40 for each chip
		- getMyParams(std::string aeroSerialNumber): Function that returns refractive index, thickness and transmission length of aerogel


#### Importing data to the LOCAL or CENTRAL DB

1.) To import the data, use steering file ARICHDatabaseImporter_import.py in arich/examples
2.) Choose between commands:
	- use_local_database("test_database.txt", "test_payloads") for local database (first argument is the name of txt file where IOVs from all payloads are written, second argument is the name of folder where payloads are stored)
	- use_central_database("ARICH", LogLevel.ERROR) for database at PNNL
3.) Uncomment "import" functions at the bottom of steering file - you can import as many classes at the same time as you want


#### Exporting data from the LOCAL DB

Exporting data from the LOCAL DB is similar to exporting data from the central DB (check instructions above). The only difference is that you have to use command use_local_database("test_database.txt", "test_payloads") in steering file ARICHDatabaseImporter_export.py. Make sure arguments are the same as when storing the data.
