This is AWESOME: Awesome Working dEtector SimulatiOn exaMplE

This directory contains a complete, working but kind of useless subdetector
including geometry, materials, sensitive detector and one module to serve as an
example who to build your own subdetector.

The contents are as follows:

data/         : XML files containing the detector description
dataobjects/  : Classes to be stored in the Datastore for usage by other
                modules or writing to file
examples/     : An example steering file to run the full simulation of the
                AWESOME detector
geometry/     : code responsible for creation of the Geant4 geometry
modules/      : modules which can be included in the processing like
                digitisation  or reconstruction modules
simulation/   : code responsible for the simulation of the detector response,
		in particular the sensitive detector implementation and
		probably routines needed for digitisation

the SConscript files are used to modify the build process, for example
specifying the libraries needed for linking. The default built process will

 - install everything in data/ into the global belle2 data dir under a
   subfolder awesome
 - install all header files in the belle2 include directory: the "include" will
   be removed from the path but the directory structure will stay the same.
   Thus geometry/include/AwesomeCreator.h will be installed as
   awesome/geometry/AwesomeCreator.h and should be included from there
 - compile everything in the dataobjects folder and put it in
   libawesome_dataobjects.so in the belle2 lib directory
 - compile everything in the modules folder and put it in libawesome_modules.so
   in the belle2 modules directory
 - compile everything under tests as unittest test suites and create an
   executable to run all tests, would be called test_awesome in this case
 - compile everything else and link it as libawesome.so in the belle2 library
   directory
