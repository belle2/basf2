Belle Data and Generic MC
-------------------------
Generic MC is the official MC samples at Belle, which was generated with
run-dependent beam background. There are multiple ``streams`` of these samples,
and each ``stream`` contains the same amount of events as present in the real
Belle data.

There are several different categories of Belle MC:
- Generic :math:`B` samples : charged (:math:`B^+ B^-`) and mixed (:math:`B^{0}\bar{B}^{0}`)
- Continuum samples  : uds, charm
- Y(5S) samples      : bsbs, nonbsbs

Generic :math:`B` samples only contain decay modes with :math:`b \to c` quark
transitions, and have been generated based on the decay tables at

How to find Generic MC and data samples?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can find the sample(s) you want through
`Belle File Search Engine`_

.. _Belle File Search Engine: http://bweb3.cc.kek.jp/


.. warning::
   `Belle File Search Engine <http://bweb3.cc.kek.jp/>`_ is only
   accessible within KEK domain or via VPN. Or look in the :ref:`onlinebook_ssh`
   tutorial for a way to access it via SSH forwarding.

   The Belle File Search Engine

By specifying ``Exp No``, ``Event Type``, ``Data Type``, and ``Stream No``,
``Event Type`` means different MC types (charged, mixed, uds, .. ).
``Data Type`` is for different energy runs (on-resonance, off-resonance, ...).
In total there are 10 streams of Generic :math:`B` samples and 6 streams of
continuum samples.

You can either use the file list (physical path) or URL as input file list for
b2bii jobs.

---------
Rare B MC
---------
Just from this name you can guess that this type of MC aims for
rarer processes, such as :math:`b \to u \ell \nu`, :math:`e^+ e^- \to \tau^+ \tau^-`...

Rare :math:`B` MC was generated with an experiment-dependent beam
energy, but not run-dependent (i.e. The same beam energy and IP profile in
the same experiment).

The location of those special MC files can be found
`here <https://belle.kek.jp/secured/wiki/doku.php?id=software:rare_mc_search>`__.


--------------------
Generating MC sample
--------------------
There are two parts when generating a MC sample:

1. `evtgen`_ generation
2. `Geant3`_-based detector simulation

.. _evtgen: https://www.slac.stanford.edu/~lange/EvtGen/
.. _Geant3: https://cds.cern.ch/record/1119728?ln=en

Users can choose between basf or B2BII to generate a set of signal MC for one's analysis.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generating signal MC with basf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``mcproduzh`` package has been used to generate signal MC in Belle for many years.
This package was developed by "U"shiroda-san, A. "Z"upanc, and "H"orii-san, and
it consists of generation, simulation, and reconstruction based on ``evtgen`` and
``gsim`` scripts (``gsim`` is Belle slang for the simulated detector response
that results from the use of ``Geant3`` within the Belle analysis software
framework ``basf`` â€“ the output of ``gsim`` scripts are Belle mdst files).

It will create MC samples for a list of experiments, normalized by their
:math:`N(B\bar{B})` or integrated luminosity.

The beam energy, IP profile, and detector configuration of this MC will be
experiment-dependent, but not run-dependent.
Moreover, ``RunNo`` for these events will be set to 0 in the ``mcproduzh`` package,
hence it doesn't work for off-resonance or :math:`\Upsilon(nS)`.

   More information of generating Belle MC in ``basf`` can be found
   `here <https://belle.kek.jp/secured/wiki/doku.php?id=software%3Amcprod_scripts>`__


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Generating signal MC with B2BII
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Signal MC samples can also be generated in basf2, using the ``BelleMCOutput`` module.
An example script of how to generate a MC sample with ``BelleMCOutput`` is at

.. code-block:: csh
   ls $BELLE2_RELEASE_DIR/b2bii/examples/BelleMCGeneration.py

Here are several notes while using ``BelleMCOutput``

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Beam energy in MC generation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The default global tag for MC generation is set to be the default gt for MC jobs,
``B2BII_MC``. The beam energy spread is not considered when the payloads were
created from the Belle DB; therefore, if you would like to include the energy
spread in MC generation, please modify the prepended global tag:
``b2bii_beamParameters_with_smearing``.

.. code-block:: python
   # Use B2BII global tag.
   basf2.conditions.prepend_globaltag('b2bii_beamParameters_with_smearing')


++++++++++++++++
Run dependent MC
++++++++++++++++
If you like to generate run-dependent beam energy MC for non-:math:`\Upsilon(4S)`
analysis, please contact conveners of your physics subgroup at Belle to get
more information regarding the list of runs for your analysis.

Then modify the following line in your generation script:

.. code-block:: python
   # Generate for experiment 55, run 0 (run-independent MC).
   main.add_module('EventInfoSetter', expList=55, runList=0, evtNumList=100)



.. note::
   Because the Belle detector geometry is not and will not be implemented in basf2, the simulation part can 
   only be done in basf.
