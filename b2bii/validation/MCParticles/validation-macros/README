1. First, fillHist01.C should be loaded and run.

 e.g.
 root [0] .L fillHist01.C
 root [1] fill01(-1)

 it fills the histograms and saves them in a root file.


2. Next, drawHist01.C should be loaded and run.

 e.g.
 root [0] .L drawHist01.C
 root [1] draw01(-1,1,0)  // save_option = 1, interactive_option = 0

 It draws BASF and BASF2 distributions of a variable in a same plot,
 and log scale can be used for Y axis. It also draws a little plot under
 each variable's distributions. This little plot shows the bin content
 difference between BASF and BASF2 distributions, and the difference
 is set as "BASF - BASF2". The output is saved as .gif and .eps files

 fillall1.c and drawall1.c macros which can be found in the above link were
 used as a reference in writing fillHist01.C and drawHist01.C macros.
