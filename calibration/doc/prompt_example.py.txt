def get_calibrations(input_data, **kwargs):
    # The only function that MUST exist in this module. It should return a LIST of Calibration objects
    # that have had their input files assigned and any configuration applied. The final output payload IoV(s)
    # should also be set correctly to be open-ended e.g. IoV(exp_low, run_low, -1, -1)
    #
    # The database_chain, CAF backend_args, backend, and heartbeat of these
    # calibrations will all be set by the b2caf-prompt-run tool.
    # You should set the `Calibration.max_subjobs` attribute yourself, probably to ~1500. But if you have many
    # Calibration objects running in parallel you might want to set  it lower per Calibration so that the total
    # number of a jobs from all parallel Calibrations is ~1000 -> 2500
    
    # The expert_config receieved here will be the combination of your defaults in the settings variable above,
    # with any values set in your caf_config.json taking precedence.
