# This file provides the execution of basf2 scripts for creating several calibration
# DSTs ready for use by the CAF example scripts.
# They don't include reconstruction steps so they are at least somewhat close to DSTs
# as they will appear in real data.

# You won't be able to use these DSTs with many of the real calibration algorithms directly as  #
# the number of events is just too low. Rather than include a script which by default generates #
# enormous files, the event numbers here are small. Just to get the test scripts working at all.#
# You should use your own scripts and numbers of events to generate sensible dataset sizes for  #
# yourself.                                                                                     #
