# You have several options about how to make a mapping of file paths -> IoV
#
# In order of most efficient -> least
#
# 1. Get the mapping from some outside source of information like a
#    database/file catalog. Then turn it into a dictionary.
#    Right now you are unlikely to do this.
#
# 2. If you know the file name or the directory it is stored in contains the
#    IoV information you don't need to call b2file-metadata-show. You could just parse
#    the file path instead. This is much faster.
#
# 3. Call b2file-metadata-show on each file, but try to do it in a multiprocessed way.
