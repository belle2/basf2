        It's the maximium simultaneous subjobs. Try not to specify a large number or a number
        larger than the number of cores (-1?). Won't crash the program but it will slow down
        and negatively impact performance. Default = 1

    running processes to finish. Once you've called join you will have to set up a new
    instance of this backend (or set max_processes again) to create a new pool.
    If you don't call self.join() and don't create a join yourself somewhere then the main
    python process might end before your pool is done.
