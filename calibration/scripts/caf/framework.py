    Every Calibration object must have a collector and at least one algorithm.
    You have the option to add in your collector/algorithm by argument here, or
    later by changing the properties.

    Parameters:
        name (str): Name of this calibration. It should be unique for use in the `CAF`
    Keyword Arguments:
        collector: Should be set to a CalibrationCollectorModule() or a string with the module name.
        algorithms: Should be set to a CalibrationAlgorithm() or a `list` of them.
        input_files (str or list[str]): Input files for use by this Calibration. May contain wildcards useable by `glob.glob`

    A Calibration won't be valid in the `CAF` until it has all of these four attributes set. For example:

    >>> cal = Calibration('TestCalibration1')
    >>> col1 = register_module('CaTest')
    >>> cal.collector = col1

    or equivalently

    >>> cal.collector = 'CaTest'

    If you want to run a basf2 :py:class:`path <basf2.Path>` before your collector module when running over data

    >>> cal.pre_collector_path = my_basf2_path

    You don't have to put a RootInput module in this pre-collection path, but you can if
    you need some special parameters.
    The inputFileNames parameter will be set by the `CAF` automatically for you.

    Adding the CalibrationAlgorithm(s) is easy

    >>> alg1 = TestAlgo()
    >>> cal.algorithms = alg1

    Or equivalently

    >>> cal.algorithms = [alg1]

    Or for multiple algorithms for one collector

    >>> alg2 = TestAlgo()
    >>> cal.algorithms = [alg1, alg2]

    Note that when you set the algorithms, they are automatically wrapped and stored as
    `Algorithm` instances. To access the algorithm underneath directly do:

    >>> cal.algorithms[i].algorithm

    If you have a setup function that you want to run before each of the algorithms, set that with

    >>> cal.pre_algorithms = my_function_object

    If you want a different setup for each algorithm use a list with the same number of elements
    as your algorithm list.

    >>> cal.pre_algorithms = [my_function1, my_function2, ...]

    You can use optional arguments to pass in some/all during initialisation of the `Calibration` class

    >>> cal = Calibration( 'TestCalibration1', 'CaTest', [alg1,alg2], ['/path/to/file.root'])

    you can change the input file list later on, before running with `CAF`

    >>> cal.input_files = ['path/to/*.root', 'other/path/to/file2.root']

    You can also specify the dependencies of the calibration on others

    >>> cal.depends_on(cal2)

    By doing this, the `CAF` will respect the ordering of the calibrations and will pass the
    calibration constants created by earlier completed calibrations to dependent ones.
