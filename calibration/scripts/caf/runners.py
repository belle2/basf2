    """
    Base class for `AlgorithmsRunner` classes. Defines the necessary information that will be provided to every
    `AlgorithmsRunner` used by the `framework.CAF`

    An `AlgorithmsRunner` will be given a list of `framework.Algorithm` objects defined during the setup of a
    `framework.Calibration` instance. The `AlgorithmsRunner` describes how to run each of the `strategies.AlgorithmStrategy`
    objects. As an example, assume that a single `framework.Calibration` was given and list of two `framework.Algorithm`
    instances to run.

    In this example the chosen :py:meth:`AlgorithmsRunner.run()` is simple and just loops over the list of `caf.framework.Algorithm`
    calling each one's :py:meth:`caf.strategies.AlgorithmStrategy.run()` methods in order.
    Thereby generating a localdb with the only communication between the `strategies.AlgorithmStrategy` instances coming from the
    database payloads being available from one algorithm to the next.

    But you could imagine a more complex situation. The `AlgorithmsRunner` might take the first `framework.Algorithm` and
    call its `AlgorithmStrategy.run` for only the first (exp,run) in the collected data. Then it might not commit the payloads
    to a localdb but instead pass some calculated values to the next algorithm to run on the same IoV. Then it might go back
    and re-run the first AlgorithmStrategy with new information and commit payloads this time. Then move onto the next IoV.

    Hopefully you can see that while the default provided `AlgorithmsRunner` and `AlgorithmStrategy` classes should be good for
    most situations, you have lot of freedom to define your own strategy if needed. By following the basic requirements for the
    interface to the `framework.CAF` you can easily plugin a different special case, or mix and match a custom class with
    default CAF ones.

    The run(self) method should be defined for every derived `AlgorithmsRunner`. It will be called once and only once for each
    iteration of (collector -> algorithm).

    Input files are automatically given via the `framework.Calibration.output_patterns` which constructs
    a list of all files in the collector output directories that match the output_patterns. If you have multiple types of
    output data it is your job to filter through the input files and assign them correctly.

    A list of local database paths are given to the `AlgorithmsRunner` based on the `framework.Calibration` dependencies and
    any overall database chain given to the Calibration before running.
    By default you can call the "setup_algorithm" transition of the `caf.state_machines.AlgorithmMachine` to automatically
    set a database chain based on this list.
    But you have freedom to not call this at all in `run`, or to implement a different method to deal with this.
