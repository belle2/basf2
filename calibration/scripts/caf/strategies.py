    Base class for Algorithm strategies. These do the actual execution of a single
    algorithm on collected data. Each strategy may be quite different in terms of how fast it may be,
    how database payloads are passed between executions, and whether or not final payloads have an IoV
    that is independent to the actual runs used to calculates them.

    Parameters:
        algorithm (:py:class:`caf.framework.Algorithm`): The algorithm we will run

    This base class defines the basic attributes and methods that will be automatically used by the selected AlgorithmRunner.
    When defining a derived class you are free to use these attributes or to implement as much functionality as you want.

    If you define your derived class with an __init__ method, then you should first call the base class
    `AlgorithmStrategy.__init__()`  method via super() e.g.

    >>> def __init__(self):
    >>>     super().__init__()

    in the required way defined by the options you have selected/attributes set.

class SimpleRunByRun(AlgorithmStrategy):
    """
    Algorithm strategy to do run-by-run calibration of collected data.
    Runs the algorithm over the input data contained within the requested IoV, starting with the first run's data only.

    This strategy differs from `SequentialRunByRun` in that it *will not merge run data* if the algorithm returns
    'not enough data' on the current run.

    Once an execution on a run returns *any* result 'iterate', 'ok', 'not_enough_data', or 'failure', we move onto the
    next run (if any are left).
    Committing of payloads to the outputdb only happens for 'iterate' or 'ok' return codes.

    .. important:: Unlike most other strategies, this one won't immediately fail and return if a run returns a 'failure' exit
                   code.
                   The failure will prevent iteration/successful completion of the CAF though.

    .. warning:: Since this strategy doesn't try to merge data from runs, if *any* run in your input data doesn't contain
                 enough data to complete the algorithm successfully, you won't be able to get a successful calibration.
                 The CAF then won't allow you to iterate this calibration, or pass the constants onward to another calibration.
                 However, you will still have the database created that covers all the successfull runs.

    This uses a `caf.state_machines.AlgorithmMachine` to actually execute the various steps rather than operating on
    a CalibrationAlgorithm C++ class directly.

    Algorithm strategy to first calculate run boundaries where execution should be attempted.
    Runs the algorithm over the input data contained within the requested IoV of the boundaries,
    starting with the first boundary data only.
    If the algorithm returns 'not enough data' on the current boundary IoV, it won't commit the payloads,
    but instead adds the next boundarie's data and tries again. Basically the same logic as `SequentialRunByRun`
    but using run boundaries instead of runs directly.
    Notice that boundaries cannot span multiple experiments.

    By default the algorithm will get the payload boundaries directly from the algorithm that need to
    have inplemented the function ``isBoundaryRequired``. If the desired boundaries are already known it
    is possible to pass them directly setting the algorithm parameter ``payload_boundaries`` and avoid
    the need to define the  ``isBoundaryRequired`` function.

    ``payload_boundaries`` is a list ``[(exp1, run1), (exp2, run2), ...]``. A boundary at the beginning of each
    experiment will be added if not already present. An empty list will thus produce a single payload for each
    experiment. A ``payload_boundaries`` set to ``None`` is equivalent to not passing it and restores the default
    behaviour where the boundaries are computed in the ``isBoundaryRequired`` function of the algorithm.
