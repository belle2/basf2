    algorithm on collected data. Each strategy may be quite different in terms of how fast it may be,
    how database payloads are passed between executions, and whether or not final payloads have an IoV
    that is independent to the actual runs used to calculates them.

    This base class defines the basic attributes and methods that will be automatically used by the selected AlgorithmRunner.
    When defining a derived class you are free to use these attributes or to implement as much functionality as you want.

    If you define your derived class with an __init__ method, then you should first call the base class
    `AlgorithmStrategy.__init__`  method via super() e.g.

    >>> def __init__(self):
    >>>     super().__init__()

    The most important method to implement is a `AlgorithmStrategy.run` method which will take an algorithm and execute it
    in the required way defined by the options you have selected/attributes set.
