def get_calibrations(input_data, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters:
      input_data (dict): Should contain every name from the 'input_data_names' variable as a key.
        Each value is a dictionary with {"/path/to/file_e1_r5.root": IoV(1,5,1,5), ...}. Useful for
        assigning to calibration.files_to_iov

      **kwargs: Configuration options to be sent in. Since this may change we use kwargs as a way to help prevent
        backwards compatibility problems. But you could use the correct arguments in b2caf-prompt-run for this
        release explicitly if you want to.

        Currently only kwargs["output_iov"] is used. This is the output IoV range that your payloads should
        correspond to. Generally your highest ExpRun payload should be open ended e.g. IoV(3,4,-1,-1)

    Returns:
      list(caf.framework.Calibration): All of the calibration objects we want to assign to the CAF process
