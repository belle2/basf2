# REQUIRED FUNCTION #
##############################
# The only function that MUST exist in this module. It should return a LIST of Calibration objects
# that have had their input files assigned and any configuration applied. The final output payload IoV(s)
# should also be set correctly to be open-ended e.g. IoV(exp_low, run_low, -1, -1)
#
# The database_chain of these calibrations will all be set/overwritten by the b2caf-prompt-run tool.


def get_calibrations(input_data, **kwargs):
    """
    Parameters:
      input_data (dict): Should contain every name from the 'input_data_names' variable as a key.
        Each value is a dictionary with {"/path/to/file_e1_r5.root": IoV(1,5,1,5), ...}. Useful for
        assigning to calibration.files_to_iov

      **kwargs: Configuration options to be sent in. Since this may change we use kwargs as a way to help prevent
        backwards compatibility problems. But you could use the correct arguments in b2caf-prompt-run for this
        release explicitly if you want to.

        Currently only kwargs["requested_iov"] and kwargs["expert_config"] are used.

        "requested_iov" is the IoV range of the bucket and your payloads should correspond to this range.
        However your highest payload IoV should be open ended e.g. IoV(3,4,-1,-1)

        "expert_config" is the input configuration. It takes default values from your `CalibrationSettings` but these are
        overwritten by values from the 'expert_config' key in your input `caf_config.json` file when running ``b2caf-prompt-run``.

    Returns:
      list(caf.framework.Calibration): All of the calibration objects we want to assign to the CAF process
