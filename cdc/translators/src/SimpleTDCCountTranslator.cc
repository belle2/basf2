if the default resolution of the CDC Digitizer is changed this value has to be changed, too!
this variance is calculated by sigam_cdcHit^2 + sigma_translationError^2
sigma_translationError is an additional (non-gaussian) smearing is introduced due to driftlength to TDC conversio  and
can be (partially) corrected by adding sigma_translationError^2 = (40/sqrt(12) µm)^2 to sigam_cdcHit^2
