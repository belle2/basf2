1: driver install into running kernel

	# ./mkdevs.sh
	# ./module_loader.sh

	Sometimes kernel complain about the version mismatch.
	It is caused by the difference of version strings of
	installed kernel source and running kernel.
	In such case, append "-f" option to insmod in "module_loader.sh".

2: test event-cycle
 2.0: configure /proc/copper/FINNESSE_STA
      Now this copper driver works even if several FINESSE slots are empty.
      You have to tell which FINNESSE slots are occupied via
      /proc/copper/FINESSE_STA.

      Bit 1 : slotA
      Bit 2 : slotB
      Bit 4 : slotC
      Bit 8 : slotD

      So if slotA and slotB are occupied and others are empty,
      Do "echo 3 > /proc/copper/FINESSE_STA" as root.
      If only slotC is occupied, "echo 4 > /proc/copper/FINESSE_STA"

      The default setting is 0xF means A,B,C,D are occupied.

 2.1: test with COPPER TRIGGER BOARD and FlashADC
	COPPER TRIGGER BOARD and FlashADC have no configuration.
	Just try
	# ./readcpr &
	  readcpr issues soft reset to FINESSE in ioctl(CPRIO_INIT_RUN).

 2.2: test with TTRX

    With AMT3 FINESSE
	Now AMT3 driver doesn't require implicit start,
	just open /dev/copper/amt3:a,b,c,d.
	Do not close them until the end of the run.

	So new test program "readamt" appears.
	(readcpr doesn't open /dev/copper/amt3)

	# ./readamt &
	# /belle/local/bin/trigrx pulse 100 100

	readamt will show first 10 events to stdout.
	If it seems to work well, try infinite loop mode.
	You can kill readamt manually by "fg" + "^C",

	# ./readamt &
	# /belle/local/bin/trigrx pulse 10000 -1

	./readamt will show one "." per 1000 events and
	/belle/local/bin/trigrx will show accepted rate.
	hit ^C to stop the trigger.
	
    With FINESSE-jig
	# ./jig-start

	You can change the data size using FINESSE_MODE environment val.
	env FINESSE_MODE=0 ./jig-start
		will set 0 words data + header + footer
			1 for 64 words data, 2 for 128....
			1:64 2:128 3:256 4:512 5:1024 6:100 7:4or1024
			
	# ./readcpr &
	# trigrx pulse 100 100
	.....

3: reset COPPER crate entirely
	If you feel COPPER board fall in crazy state,
	# ./copper-sysreset
	This makes sysreset signal on the backplane.
	All board in the same crate must reboot.
