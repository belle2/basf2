   * Generic base class for all standalone ZMQ applications.

   * the input and the output connection.
   * By default, the main loop listens on the output and monitoring socket(s)
   * while the output is not ready and also listens on the input if the output is ready.
   *
   * Before starting the main loop, the virtual initialize() function should be called.
   * When the input socket receives a message, the virtual "handleInput" function is called
   * (defaults to handleIncomingData of the connection).
   * When the output socket receives a message, the virtual "handleOutput" function is called
   * (defaults to handleIncomingData of the connection).
   * When the monitoring receives a signal message, the virtual "handleExternalSignal" function is called
   * (defaults to nothing).
   * When the timeout is set to a value other than 0, the virtual handleTimeout function is called
   * with the given frequency (defaults to nothing).
   *
   * Be reimplementing those four functions (or parts of them), the behaviour can be customized.
