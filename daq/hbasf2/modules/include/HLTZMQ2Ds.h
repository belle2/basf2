  /**
   * Input module in the ZMQ reconstruction path receiving events via ZMQ
   * and deserializing the to the data store. The connection to the previous ZMQ application
   * (most likely a distributor or collector) is handled via a load balanced connection
   * (input in this case). The buffer size for the load balanced connection can be
   * controlled via a module parameter.
   * This module only works in the context of the HLT when using the HLTEventProcessor,
   * due to the special form the first event as well as beginRun and endRun are handled.
   * Please read the overall description in the HLTEventProcessor for an overview.
   *
   * Before the first real event is received (which is the first time the event function
   * is called by the HLTEventProcessor, but before the forking), the
   * event meta data is initialized with a predefined experiment and run number (set via
   * module parameters) so make module initialization in all other modules possible.
   * However, no event function should be called for other modules in this event
   * (as the data store is invalid). In the first real event after the forking,
   * the connection and streamer is initialized. Then, normal event messages
   * are deserialized and written to data store. End run or terminate messages are
   * handled by setting a special flag of the EventMetaData. Also in this case
   * the remaining modules should not process this event via an event function
   * (assured by the HLTEventProcessor).
   *
   * TODO: currently, this module is also used in the ExressReco use case, which
   * is good as it makes things more uniform. THe downside is, that we also have to define
   * the store arrays, which are not so trivial in this case (and needs to be kep in sync).
   * We might change this in the future.
