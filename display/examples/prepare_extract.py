# Create a geometry extract (needed for R-Phi and R-Z projections)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
#
# PLEASE READ COMMENTS IN THIS SCRIPT
#
# Geometry extract is a simplified and small version of the geometry
# stored in a ROOT file and loaded by default (from display/data/geometry_extract.root)
# It is needed for R-Phi and R-Z projection (empty for full geometry).
# It is faster to display and manipulate (zoom, rotation) than full geometry
#
# This script will open Display, where one can:
# 1) Remove volumes to have reasonably-sized extract
#    - Go to Eve panel -> Scenes -> Geometry scene
#    - Select volumes to be removed completely from the extract by right-clicking
#      on them and selecting 'Destroy' from the pop-up menu
# 2) Hide volumes for better visibility (just un-check their check-box).
#    These can be later re-enabled in the Display.
# 3) Change volume colors, transparency etc. (only in the Display UI)
# 4) Save the extract from window menu by clicking on Scene -> Save geometry extract
#    It will be saved in current directory with name 'geometry_extract.root'
#
# NOTE: 1) and 2) can be done also automatically from the script (read below)
# NOTE: You are supposed to review / slightly modify the visual appearance in
#       the Display UI. But using the parameters in this script can save you from
#       lot of tedious work of destroying hundreds of volumes by hand

# Use RootInput instead EventInfoSetter (not both!) if you want
# to load some event data from a ROOT file
main.add_module('EventInfoSetter')

# You can specify different geometry here, e.g. Phase2
# Select only sub-detectors you want to show (e.g. no BeamPipe) in components
# WARNING: ECL cannot be displayed (will crash due to unsupported volumes)

# List of volumes to be hidden (can be re-enabled in Eve panel / Geometry scene)
# The volumes and all their daughters will be hidden.
# NOTE: Volume names in the Eve panel have usually a suffix ('_1' etc. which you have to omit here)
#       For example 'BKLM.EnvelopeLogical' is named 'BKLM.EnvelopeLogical_1' but here you need to specify
#       them without the suffix (their visualisation is changed directly in geometry in memory - which
#       has no effect to e.g. simulation - but many volumes have the same name)
#       For example 'PXD.Switcher_refl' will hide all 'PXD.Switcher_refl_#' you could see in the Eve panel.
display.param('hideVolumes', ['logicalCDC',
                              'ARICH.masterVolume',
                              'BKLM.EnvelopeLogical',
                              'Endcap_1',
                              'Endcap_2'])

# List of volumes to be deleted. This time the suffix is needed.
# NOTE: These are REGULAR EXPRESSIONS from ROOT, see:
#       https://root.cern.ch/root/html534/TPRegexp.html
#
# NOTE: If the expression starts with '#', only children of this
#       element are deleted (sometimes useful), the leading '#'
#       is removed before making regular expression.
# WARNING: For some reason one can still expand this in the Eve panel, which
#          will cause the children elements to re-appear (strange, why?!) -
#          so do not click (expand) it if you do not want it in the extract
#
# Some usefull examples:
#
# - You need to escape special characters like '.' (dot) by '\\'
#   For example to select all volumes which contain 'PXD.ReadoutChips', use:
#   'PXD\\.ReadoutChips'
#
# - To select exactly the volume with given name, e.g. 'logicalCDC_0', use:
#   '^logicalCDC_0$'
#
# - To select any volume which contains some string, e.g. 'Encap_1'. 'LayerEndcap_2' etc., use simply:
#   'Endcap'
#
# - To select volumes starting with some string, e.g. 'Endcap_1', 'Endcap_2' etc., use:
#   '^Endcap'
#
# - '.*' means any or no characters, so e.g. to remove volumes which contain
#   'PXD.Switcher', 'PXD.SwitcherChip', 'Switcher' etc., you could use:
#   'Switcher.*'
#
# A B2INFO message is issued for every volume deleted. Please check the output is what you expect.
#
# Follows a default list used to create Phase 3(2) extract:
# NOTE: One can do much more efficiently with regular expressions...
#       I keep this list if someone would like to re-enable some parts without
#       all the work of going through the geometry scene.
