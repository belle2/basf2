  /**
   * The ModuleManager Class.
   *
   * This class is responsible for creating and managing new module instances.
   * The module manager can only find those modules, whose shared library files are located in one of the
   * directories known to the module manager. Directories can be added to the directory list with
   * the method addModuleSearchPath(). By adding a new directory, the directory is searched for *.map
   * files which specify the kind of modules that can be found in the shared library files. The map files
   * are parsed and the found modules are added to an internal list.
   *
   * If a shared library is loaded by the module manager, all modules inside the library automatically
   * register themselves to the module manager. This is done by a so-called proxy class. Each module has a proxy
   * class attached to it, which does the registration with the module manager and is later used to create
   * the actual instance of the module. By using a proxy class, the module itself is only instantiated
   * if the user requests it.
   *
   * The creation of a new module instance works as following:
   * 1) The user requests a new module by calling the method registerModule() with the module name given as a parameter.<br>
   * 2) The ModuleManager checks if a proxy class was already registered for the given module name. If yes, the proxy creates
   * a new module instance. Otherwise the modules known to the manager are searched for the given module name. If the
   * module is known to the module manager the associated shared library is dynamically loaded.
   *
   * This class is designed as a singleton.
