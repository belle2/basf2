   * This class is what every DBObjPtr and DBArray are pointing to. It owns the
   * TFile pointer for the payload and the payload object itself.
   *
   * Any update of the Payload goes through here: when the payload changes
   * after a run the updatePayload() will be called with the new revision, iov
   * and filename. This class then opens the File and obtains the payload
   * object.
   *
   * \warning Users should not need to use this class at all but just need
   *          DBObjPtr and DBArray.
   *
   * This class also supports raw file payloads (where we do not even open the
   * file but will just return the filename to interested parties) or ROOTFile
   * payloads (where we make sure the file can be read by ROOT but don't
   * extract anything from it) But at the moment there is no api to use these
   * types.
