   *                       if the angle from the xy perigee position vector to the transverse momentum vector is +pi/2 (-pi/2).
   *                       @f$d_0@f$ has the same sign as `getPerigee().Cross(getMomentum()).Z()`.
   *  2. @f$ \phi_0 @f$ - the angle in the xy projection between the transverse momentum and the x axis, which is in [-pi, pi]
   *  3. @f$ \omega @f$ - the signed curvature of the track where the sign is given by the charge of the particle
   *  4. @f$ z_0 @f$ - z coordinate of the perigee
   *  5. @f$ \tan \lambda @f$ - the slope of the track in the sz plane (dz/ds)
   *
   *  in that exact order.
   *
   *  Each point on the helix can be adressed by the two dimensional arc length s, which has to be traversed to get to it from the perigee.
   *  More precisely the two dimensional arc length means the transverse part of the particles travel distance,
   *  hence the arc length of the circle in the xy projection.
