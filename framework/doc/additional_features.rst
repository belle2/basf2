Additional Features
-------------------

* All documented basf2 modules and variables are automatically added to a
  separate, alphabetic index page for easy lookup. They can be referenced with

  - ``:ref:`b2-modindex``` (:ref:`b2-modindex`)
  - ``:ref:`b2-varindex``` (:ref:`b2-varindex`)


.. FIXME: let's check if this still works
.. * We have support for easy linking to GitLab issues by using
..  ``:issue:`BII-XXXX```, for example ``:issue:`BII-8``` (:issue:`BII-8`)
