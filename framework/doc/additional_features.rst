Additional Features
-------------------

* All documented basf2 modules and variables are automatically added to a
  separate, alphabetic index page for easy lookup. They can be referenced with

  - ``:ref:`b2-modindex``` (:ref:`b2-modindex`)
  - ``:ref:`b2-varindex``` (:ref:`b2-varindex`)


* We have support for easy linking to basf2 GitLab issues by using
  ``:issue:`XXXX```, for example ``:issue:`9819``` (:issue:`9819`).
  Note that this works only for the issues related to the
  `basf2 project <https://gitlab.desy.de/belle2/software/basf2/-/issues/>`_.
  Issues from different projects have to be linked in the standard way.
