Local Installation from Source
==============================

If your machine runs on one of the following distributions we recommend to
:ref:`install precompiled software <local-install-precompiled>`:

.. include:: supported-distributions.rst-fragment

If you don't run on any of these distributions you will need to install the
Software from Source. First you need to install the :ref:`belle2-tools`.
