Changes in the framework package
--------------------------------

Job Information File
++++++++++++++++++++

basf2 has a new command line parameter ``--job-information=<filename>`` to
create a json file with some statistics on the processing and detailed
information on all created output files.

.. seealso:: `BELLE2-NOTE-TE-2017-012: Software and Computing Interface <https://docs.belle2.org/record/609>`_


Python Interface
++++++++++++++++

* Additional utility function `b2test_utils.check_error_free` used to
  automate a code quality (or indeed any) tool check. It requires
  execution without any output as part of the unit tests. For example the
  analysis package now requires no doxygen or cppcheck warnings.
* Additional utility function `b2test_utils.configure_logging_for_tests` to
  improve reproducibility of log output for testing purposes by replacing
  certain setup dependent names of directories with placeholders.
* The `Pager <terminal_utils.Pager>` class has been moved to a new module
  `terminal_utils` which now also contains a new class `InputEditor
  <terminal_utils.InputEditor>` to open a editor when asking the user for a
  long message similar to ``git commit``
* The compatibility imports of `sys`, `os` and the ``fw`` object have been
  removed from `basf2`. Every method which was previously part of the ``fw``
  object is now just a function in the `basf2` module.

Core Framework
++++++++++++++

* Addition of helpful ``StoreArray::hasRelationTo`` and
  ``StoreArray::hasRelationFrom`` methods.
* Deprecated static methods to register ``StoreArray`` instances have been
  removed.

Command line Tools
++++++++++++++++++

* :ref:`b2file-metadata-add <b2file-metadata-add>` will now only update the
  file in the FileCatalog if it is already registered. It will also now
  correctly remove the old LFN from the file catalog.
* :ref:`b2file-merge <b2file-merge>` will by default no longer register files
  in the file catalog. You can either supply ``--add-to-catalog`` as argument
  or run ``b2file-catalog-add`` on the output file. Use the latter if you want
  to write scripts which work also with older releases.
* :ref:`b2file-normalize <b2file-normalize>` has been added to remove
  timestamps and similar non-reproducible features from ROOT files.
* :ref:`b2file-remove-branches <b2file-remove-branches>` has been added to
  remove obsolete branches from old files.
* the commands of the `b2conditionsdb <b2conditionsdb>` tool are now also
  available with dashed version, e.g. ``b2conditionsb-tag-show``
* A number of old tool names which were kept for compatibility have been
  removed. The old tool names still exist but raise an error pointing to the
  new name.

Modules
+++++++

* b2:mod:`RootOutput` module: changed default value for ``updateFileCatalog``
  to False. This will avoid creating ``Belle2FileCatalog.xml`` or warning about
  overwriting entries in the file catalog by default. The file catalog is only
  needed when loading parent files and can always be created later using
  ``b2file-catalog-add``

     :ref:`b2file-catalog-add <b2file-catalog-add>`
