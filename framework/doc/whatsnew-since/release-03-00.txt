Changes in the framework package
--------------------------------

Python Interface
++++++++++++++++

* Additional utility function `b2test_utils.check_error_free` used to
  automate a code quality (or indeed any) tool check. It requires
  execution without any output as part of the unit tests. For example the
  analysis package now requires no doxygen or cppcheck warnings.

Core Framework
++++++++++++++

* Addition of helpful `StoreArray::hasRelationTo` and
  `StoreArray::hasRelationFrom` methods.

Command line Tools
++++++++++++++++++

* :ref:`b2file-metadata-add <b2file-metadata-add>` will now only update the
  file in the FileCatalog if it is already registered. It will also now
  correctly remove the old LFN from the file catalog.
* :ref:`b2file-merge <b2file-merge>` will by default no longer register files
  in the file catalog. You can either supply ``--add-to-catalog`` as argument
  or run ``b2file-catalog-add`` on the output file. Use the latter if you want
  to write scripts which work also with older releases.


Modules
+++++++

* b2:mod:`RootOutput` module: changed default value for ``updateFileCatalog``
  to False. This will avoid creating `Belle2FileCatalog.xml` or warning about
  overwriting entries in the file catalog by default. The file catalog is only
  needed when loading parent files and can always be created later using
  ``b2file-catalog-add``
