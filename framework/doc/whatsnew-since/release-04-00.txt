Changes in the framework package since release-04-00-00
-------------------------------------------------------

Conditions Database
+++++++++++++++++++

* :ref:`b2conditionsdb` has been optimized to work with larger globaltags.
* ``b2conditionsdb-diff`` and ``b2conditionsdb-iov`` by default don't show any database internal ids anymore but those can be re-enabled with ``--show-ids``
* ``b2conditionsdb-dump`` has learned a new argument to show the content of a payload valid for a given run in a given globaltag
* There are new python classes to handle iovs, see `conditions_db.iov`


Logging
+++++++

* Added support to escape newlines in all log messages by setting
  `logging.enable_escape_newlines <basf2.LogPythonInterface.enable_escape_newlines>`.
* Added support to suppress messages if they repeated for a certain number of times.
  This is disabled by default but can be enabled with
  `logging.max_repetitions <basf2.LogPythonInterface.max_repetitions>`.

Miscellaneous
+++++++++++++

 * Added support for writing ``udst`` files as output from BGxN N>0 files in light releases (see :issue:`BII-3622`). This means skimming is fully supported with a light release.
 * Added support for b2bii in light releases. However, this comes at the cost of no longer being able to convert ExtHits and ECLHits.
 * The :b2:mod:`RootInput` will now by default skip events which have an error flag set. This can be changed with the ``discardErrorEvents`` parameter.
 * Added the function `basf2.get_file_metadata` to quickly obtain the FileMetaData object of a given basf2 output file.
 * Added the tools ``b2code-sphinx-build`` and ``b2code-sphinx-warnings`` to build the sphinx documentation or check for warnings when building the documentation.
