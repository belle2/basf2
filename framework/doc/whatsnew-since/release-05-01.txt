Changes in the framework package since release-05-01
----------------------------------------------------

Conditions Database
+++++++++++++++++++

* :ref:`b2conditionsdb-tag-merge` has been added to merge a number of globaltags into a single globaltag
  in the order they are given. The result is equivalent to having multiple globaltags setup in the 
  conditions access for basf2.
* :ref:`b2conditionsdb-tag-runningupdate` has been added to calculate and apply the necessary updates to 
  a running globaltag with a given staging globaltag.
* ``b2conditionsdb-download`` has learned a new argument to clean all payload files not mentioned in
  the database file from the download area.


Tools
+++++

* Added ``b2rundb-query`` to perform simple rundb queries from the command line.


Python Interface
++++++++++++++++

 * The `ANSIColors <terminal_utils.ANSIColors>` class has been added to the module `terminal_utils` to
   very easily add color output to the terminal.
* Added a `RunDB <rundb.RunDB>` class which makes writing scripts using the rundb more straightforward.
