Changes in the framework package since release-05-01
----------------------------------------------------

* Added ``b2help-modules`` which behaves identical to ``basf2 -m`` but more
  in-keeping with the ``b2help-<something>`` theme.


Conditions Database
+++++++++++++++++++

* The format in which local database payloads are created has changed slightly, see :ref:`cdb_payload_creation`
* ``b2conditionsdb-tag-merge`` has been added to merge a number of globaltags into a single globaltag
  in the order they are given. The result is equivalent to having multiple globaltags setup in the 
  conditions access for basf2.
* ``b2conditionsdb-tag-runningupdate`` has been added to calculate and apply the necessary updates to 
  a running globaltag with a given staging globaltag.
* ``b2conditionsdb-download`` has learned a new argument to clean all payload files not mentioned in
  the database file from the download area.


Tools
+++++

* Added ``b2rundb-query`` to perform simple rundb queries from the command line.


Python Interface
++++++++++++++++

* The `ANSIColors <terminal_utils.ANSIColors>` class has been added to the module `terminal_utils` to
  very easily add color output to the terminal.
* Added a `RunDB <rundb.RunDB>` class which makes writing scripts using the rundb more straightforward.
