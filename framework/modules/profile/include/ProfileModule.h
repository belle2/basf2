   * A module that measures the execution time and memory usage per event.
   *
   * This module adds a ProfileInfo object to the datastore and records
   * execution time and memory usage in it.
   *
   * Both the virtual memory and the resident set size (rss) of the process
   * is reported. Both quantities are important and have a complementary meaning:
   *
   * virtual size (vsize): The memory region the kernal has reserved for the process
   * in its memory management, included swapped pages (which are not in RAM, but on disk) and
   * half-filled pages.
   * It also includes files which get mapped into the memory region of the process, but are only
   * loaded on-demand in RAM. All libraries loaded are memory-mapped and show up in the vsize.
   *
   * resident set size (rss): The Rss is the memory which is actually occupied by
   * the process in the physical RAM of the machine. It usually is significantly smaller
   * than the vsize. This is the quantity which should actually be used when checking
   * and optimizing the memory consumption of the application.
