    Merge a list of globaltags in the order they are given.

    This command allows to merge a number of globaltags into a single globaltag.
    Payloads from later globaltags in the list of arguments are used to fill gaps
    present in earlier globaltags.

    The result is equivalent to having multiple globaltags setup in the conditions
    access for basf2 (highest priority goes first).

    Warning:
      The order of the globaltags is highest priority first, so payloads from
      globaltags earlier on the command line will be taken with before globaltags
      from later tags.

      This command requires that all globaltags are overlap free.

    For each globaltag in the list we copy all payloads to the output globaltag
    if there is no payload of that name valid for the given interval of validity
    in any previous globaltags in the list.

    If the payload overlaps partially with a payload from a previous globaltag
    in the list the interval of validity is shortened (and possibly split) to
    not overlap but to just fill the gaps.

    For example:

    globaltag A contains ::

        payload1, rev 2, valid from 1,0 to 1,10
        payload1, rev 3, valid from 1,20 to 1,22
        payload2, rev 1, valid from 1,0 to 1,-1

    globaltag B contains ::

        payload1, rev 1, valid from 1,1 to 1,30
        payload2, rev 2, valid from 0,1 to 1,20

    Then running ``b2conditionsdb tag merge -o output A B``, the output globaltag
    after the merge will contain::

        payload1, rev 2, valid from 1,0 to 1,10
        payload1, rev 1, valid from 1,11 to 1,19
        payload1, rev 3, valid from 1,20 to 1,22
        payload1, rev 1, valid from 1,23 to 1,30
        payload2, rev 2, valid from 0,1 to 0,-1
        payload2, rev 1, valid from 1,0 to 1,-1

    When finished, this command will print a table of payloads and their
    validity and from which globaltag they were taken. If ``--dry-run`` is given
    it will only print the list of payloads.

    Optionally one can specify ``--run-range`` to limit the run range for which
    the merging should take place. In the example above, running with
    ``--run-range 1 0 1 21`` the result would be ::

        payload1, rev 2, valid from 1,0 to 1,10
        payload1, rev 1, valid from 1,11 to 1,19
        payload1, rev 3, valid from 1,20 to 1,21

    """
    Update a running globaltag with payloads from a staging tag

    This command will calculate and apply the necessary updates to a running
    globaltag with a given staging globaltag

    Running tags are defined as "immutable for existing data but conditions for
    newer runs may be added" and the only modification allowed is to add new
    payloads for new runs or close existing payloads to no longer be valid for
    new runs.

    This command takes previously prepared and validated payloads in a staging
    globaltag and will then calculate which payloads to close and what to add to
    the running globaltag.

    For this to work we require

    1. A running globaltag in the state "RUNNING"

    2. A (experiment, run) number from which run on the update should be valid.
       This run number needs to be

        a) bigger than the start of validity for all iovs in the running tag
        b) bigger than the end of validity for all closed iovs (i.e. not valid
           to infinity) in the running tag

    3. A staging globaltag with the new payloads in state "VALIDATED"

        a) payloads in the staging tag starting at (0,0) will be interpreted as
           starting at the first valid run for the update
        b) all other payloads need to start at or after the first valid run for
           the update.
        c) The globaltag needs to be gap and overlap free
        d) All payloads in the staging tag should have as last iov an open iov
           (i.e. valid to infinity) but this can be disabled.

    The script will check all the above requirements and will then calculate the
    necessary operations to

    1. Add all payloads from the staging tag where a start validity of (0, 0) is
       replaced by the starting run for which this update should be valid.
    2. close all iovs for payloads in the running tags just before the
       corresponding iov of the same payload in the staging tag, so either at the
       first run for the update to be valid or later
    3. Optionally, make sure all payloads in the staging tag end in an open iov.

    Example:

        running tag contains ::

            payload1, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to 1,0
            payload1, rev 2, valid from 1,1 to -1,-1
            payload2, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to -1,-1
            payload3, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to 1,0
            payload4, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to -1,-1
            payload5, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to -1,-1

        staging tag contains ::

            payload1, rev 3, valid from 0,0 to 1,8
            payload1, rev 4, valid from 1,9 to 1,20
            payload2, rev 2, valid from 1,5 to 1,20
            payload3, rev 2, valid from 0,0 to -1,-1
            payload4, rev 1, valid from 0,0 to 1,20

        Then running ``b2conditionsdb tag runningupdate running staging --run 1 2 --allow-closed``,
        the running globaltag after the update will contain ::

            payload1, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to 1,0
            payload1, rev 2, valid from 1,1 to 1,1
            payload1, rev 3, valid from 1,2 to 1,8
            payload1, rev 4, valid from 1,9 to 1,20
            payload2, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to 1,4
            payload2, rev 2, valid from 1,5 to 1,20
            payload3, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to 1,0
            payload3, rev 2, valid from 1,2 to -1,-1
            payload4, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to 1,20
            payload5, rev 1, valid from 0,1 to -1,-1

        Note that

        - the start of payload1 and payload3 in staging has been adjusted
        - payload2 in the running tag as been closed at 1,4, just before the
          validity from the staging tag
        - payload3 was already closed in the running tag so no change is
          performed. This might result in gaps but is intentional
        - payload4 was not closed at rim 1,2 because the staging tag had the same
          revision of the payload so the these were merged to one long validity.
        - payload5 was not closed as there was no update to it in the staging tag.
          If we would have run with ``--full-replacement`` it would have been closed.
        - if we would have chosen ``--run 1 1`` the update would have failed because
          payload1, rev2 in running starts at 1,1 so we would have a conflict
        - if we would have chosen ``--run 1 6`` the update would have failed because
          payload2 in the staging tag starts before this run
        - if we would have chosen to open the final iovs in staging by using
          ``--fix-closed``, payload1, rev 4; payload2, rev 2 and payload4 rev 1
          would be valid until -1,-1 after the running tag. In fact, payload 4
          would not be changed at all.
