    Interval of validity class to support set operations like union and
    intersection.

    An interval of validity is a set of runs for which something is valid. An
    IntervalOfValidity consists of a `first` valid run and a `final` valid run.

    Warning:
        The `final` run is inclusive so the the validity is including the final run.

    Each run is identified by a experiment number and a run number. Accessing
    `first` or `final` will return a tuple ``(experiment, run)`` but the
    elements can also be accessed separately with `first_exp`, `first_exp`,
    `final_exp` and `final_run`.

    For `final` there's a special case where either the run or both, the run and
    the experiment number are infinite. This means the validity extends to all
    values. If only the run number is infinite then it's valid for all further
    runs in this experiment. If both are infinite the validity extends to everything.

    For simplicity ``-1`` can be passed in instead of infinity when creating objects.
