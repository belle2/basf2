    Handler class to start processes in an IPython notebook in a convenient way.
    From this whole framework you should not need to create any instances by yourself but rather use the
    given ipython handler for this.

    Usage
    -----

    Create a handler object in the beginning of your NB and use the two methods `process`
    and `process_parameter_space` to turn parameters or a parameter creator function into a Calculation.
    Do not create calculations on you own.

        Create a list of calculations by combining all parameters with all parameters you provide and
        feeding the tuple into the parameter_creator_function.
        If the kwargs_creator_function has a parameter named queue, the function feeds the corresponding
        created queue into the parameter_creator_function.
        The parameter_creator_function must return a dictionary for every combination of parameters it gets,
        which will be used to construct a process out of it.
        See ipython_handler_basf2/ipython_handler for an example.

        Please note that a list of calculations acts the same as a single calculation you would get from
        the process function. You can handle 10 calculations the same way you would handle a single one.

        The kwargs_creator_function can transform the incoming parameters into different ones. To make this
        more clear, the resulting dictionary created by the kwargs_creator_function is called kwargs.
        These are the ones, that will be used to create a calculation process, so they must be compatible to the
        calculation you chose (namely compatible with the append function of the _calculation_type).

        Arguments
        ---------
        kwargs_creator_function: A function with as many input parameters as parameters you provide.
           If the function has an additional queue parameter it is fed with the corresponding queue for this calculation.
        parameter_lists: As many lists as you want. Every list is one parameter. If you do not want a
           specific parameter constellation to occur, you can return None in your parameter_creator_function for
           this combination.
