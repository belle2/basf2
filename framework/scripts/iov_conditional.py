def make_conditional_at(path, iov_list, path_when_in_iov, path_when_not_in_iov=None):
    """
    Branch the current path execution based on the given iov list.
    If the current exp/run is met by one of the IoV conditions, execute the path given in
    `path_when_in_iov` and continue the normal path afterwards. Else, execute the `path_when_not_in_iov`
    when given.

    Basically, this function is just a wrapper around adding the IoVDependentCondition module to the path.

    Example:

    >>> make_conditional_at(path, iov_list=[(0, 0, 0, -1)],
    ...                     path_when_in_iov=exp_0_path,
    ...                     path_when_not_in_iov=not_exp_0_path)

    will branch the path for all events with experiment number 0 to the modules in exp_0_path and into
    not_exp_0_path in all other cases.

    Parameters:
        path: Branch the execution of the given path.
        iov_list: Under which IoV conditions should the `path_when_in_iov` be executed. It should be a list in the form
                  [(min exp, min run, max exp, max run), ...]
        path_when_in_iov: Which branch to execute, if one of the IoV conditions is met.
        path_when_not_in_iov: If given, execute this path in all cases, none IoV condition is met.
