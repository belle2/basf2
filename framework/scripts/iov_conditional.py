"""
iov_conditional - Functions to Execute Paths Depending on Experiment Phases
===========================================================================

This module contains some convenience functions to execute different paths
depending on the experiment run number. This allows to write one common steering
file for phases 2 and 3.

Warning:
    All Modules will be initialized on startup of the framework. This might
    cause problems if the modules initialize some common global state. For
    example, adding ``Geometry`` modules with different parameters will not
    work as expected.

def make_conditional_at(path, iov_list, path_when_in_iov, path_when_not_in_iov=None):
    """
    Branch the current path execution based on the given iov list.  If the
    current exp/run is met by one of the IoV conditions, execute the path given
    in ``path_when_in_iov`` and continue the normal path afterwards. Otherwise
    execute the ``path_when_not_in_iov`` when given.

    Basically, this function is just a wrapper around adding the
    :b2:mod:`IoVDependentCondition` module to the path.

    See Also:
        If you just need to distinguish between phase 2/3 please use
        `phase_2_conditional()`

    Example:

        >>> make_conditional_at(path, iov_list=[(0, 0, 0, -1)],
        ...                     path_when_in_iov=exp_0_path,
        ...                     path_when_not_in_iov=not_exp_0_path)

    will branch the path for all events with experiment number 0 to the modules
    in ``exp_0_path`` and into ``not_exp_0_path`` in all other cases.

    Parameters:
        path (basf2.Path): Branch the execution of the given path.
        iov_list (list(tuple)): Under which IoV conditions should the
            ``path_when_in_iov`` be executed. It should be a list in the form
            ``[(min exp, min run, max exp, max run), ...]``
        path_when_in_iov (basf2.Path): Which branch to execute, if one of the IoV conditions is met.
        path_when_not_in_iov (basf2.Path): If given, execute this path in all cases, none IoV condition is met.

    Parameters:
