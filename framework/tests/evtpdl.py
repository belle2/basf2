"""
Check reading and writing of evt.pdl files as well as errors when creating new particles.

This script tests that
 - the ROOT.TDatabasePDG instance is in fact an EvtGenDatabasePDG
 - reading a pdl file raises a warning if it's not the original one
 - creating a particle which already exists is forbidden
 - creating particles with whitespace in the name is forbidden
 - writing an evt.pdl results in the same output as the original pdl, except for
   whitespace and additionally defined particles
