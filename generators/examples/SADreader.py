######################################################## This steering file
# shows all options for the simulation of background events fed from SAD input
# files.
#
# Please note: The SAD input file contains weighted particles, in the following
# called 'SAD particles'. Thus, one particle in the input file doesn't
# correspond to one 'real' particle in an event. In order to simulate the
# background for your subdetector, you have two possibilities:
#
# a) Create unweighted events by setting the 'ReadMode' to 1 and 'ReadoutTime'
# to the correct readout time of your subdetector. Then run over ALL events in
# the input file. The result will be a ROOT file containing all particles which
# hit your subdetector during one readout frame/cycle of your subdetector.
#
# b) Create weighted events by setting the 'ReadMode' to 0. Run over ALL events
# in the input file. Each event will contain one MonteCarlo track, carrying the
# weight information. Using this information you can then scale the result to
# your subdetector readout time.
#
# Which one you choose depends on the background studies you would like to
# perform. For example, if you are interested in the details of your
# subdetector occupancy, it is recommended to choose a). On the other hand, if
# you are interested in the flux or rate of the background hitting your
# subdetector, you can choose b).

# Set the ReadMode of the SAD input module. 0 = one SAD particle per event.
