Jan 26 2020
- Added HepMC3 support. Thanks Andrii Verbytskyi for his help in setting it up
Nov 17 2017
- Draft for anomalous couplings in Z NLO matrix element introduced
Nov 7 2015
- Technical parameter to conpensate kinematic shifting, due to earlier photon emissions, 
  increased. Necessary for  non-relativistic (charge TWO) decay products. It increases the size 
  of the crude distribution removing fatal error in such events. 
  Thanks to Torben Ferber for input.
Sept 29 2015
- Change to enable use of Photos in case when there are no incoming (beam
  or grandmother(s) ) for the decaying particle. Relevant part of the code, 
  requiring the adaptation, became active since introduction of pair 
  emission in  Photos v. 3.57. This created a problem for EvtGen interface. 
  Such non-standard contents of event records will continue to
  result in some cases of downgraded precision, but not anymore to fault. 
  In particular, matrix elements in case of Z/gamma*/W
  (in future also narrow vector states) decays, can not be then calculated. 
  Thanks to John Back and Michal Kreps for the input. 
Apr 26 2015
- cleaning of code, examples reference files completed. 
  Version no 3.60 introduced, code prepared for submission to CPC 
Mar 24 2015
- examples updated to pythia v8.2
- LCG scripts updated to the new directory structure and pythia v8.2
- examples/README-PYTHIA-VERSIONS added explaining how to use examples with
  older pythia versions
Mar 2 2015
- version 3.58 introduced
- directory structure reorganized to get rid of misleading FORTRAN keyword and obsolete
  photosFortranInterfaces directory.
- libraries content and name changed. Now HEPEVT and HepMC interface can be
  linked separately
- The new libraries are linked as: -lPhotospp -lPhotosppHEPEVT -lPhotosppHepMC
Feb 26 2015
- tests and rounding error fix for simultaneous pairs and photons generation in long runs
Feb 3 2015
- Emission of extra lepton  pairs introduced. 
- Tests of phase space (presamples on/off): comparison with flat space
  completed  
- Soft matrix element installed and normalization of numerical results
  checked (as function of maximum energy of pairs and lepton mass) 
  at 2 % precision level
- distributions checked to look resonable, but no comparison with 
  semi-analytical results.
- documentation and test need to be completed.
- Version 3.57 introduced
May 3 2014
- Adaptation for new class of events written to HepMC by new releases of
  Pythia and spotted in versions newer thant 8.165
Apr 7 2014
- Exit codes in case of an error changed to -1 (previously it was mostly 0)
- Version 3.55 released
Feb  1 2014
- Fix for gcc 4.8.1 introduced (thanks to Rafael Delgado Lopez for warning);
  Photos++ has been  tested on gcc 4.8.1. While no further problems
  were found, due to nature of changes in gcc 4.8, we are  not confident
  that Photos++ will work correctly in all conditions and for this 
  version of gcc. We plan further tests.
Nov 22 2013
- Fixed bug that caused segmentation fault in rare cases when
  HepMC::GenParticle::parent_event() caused invalid memory read
  Thanks Wojciech Kotlarski for finding it out
Nov 21 2013
- Added compatibility for FORTRAN generators that use different standard
  of setting mother ID in HEPEVT event record
- LCG scripts updated
- Number of compilation warnings removed
- Code tested within both C++ and Fortran environments
Jul 20 2013
- Code fully located in Photospp namespace
Jul 12 2013
- version 3.54 is free of fortran, but need to be tested/cleaned.
Nov 04 2012
- Photos::setRandomGenerator() added, it can substitute native random 
  number generator with the user provided one.
Nov 02 2012
- ME correction for W fixed; it can work for multichannel samples as well
- Boosting os grandaughters for ultrarelativistic mothers fixed with the help
  of PHCORK(0) added to PHOOUT routine. Resulting from there 4-vectors 
  are used in kinematic modifications of C++
- Photos::forceMass and Photos::forceMassFromEventRecord now work regardless
  of  whether Photos::forceMassFrom4Vector is true or false.
Oct 28 2012
- Info, that until now ME in W decay can be used only for single channel,
  that means only one decay channel of either W+ or W- for the particular
  run.  
Aug 14 2012
- Photos will not act on Pomerons and its diffractive states. This was
  physically incorrect and even could cause NaNs to appear in the event.  
  This protection was not necessary in the past.
- Fixed bug in algorithm for kinematic adjustment introduced in 
  update of Apr 24
- Fixed bug which in rare cases caused segmentation fault on 32-bit platform
  with gcc 4.1
- Examples updated for compatibility with Tauola v1.0.7

Apr 24 2012
- kinematic adjustment for vertex where all outgoing dauhters self-decay
  introduced, self decay vertices for photons generated by photos are added. 
Apr 22 2012
- Momentum conservation check for all stable particles in the event
  added to the examples.

Apr 19 2012
  Further extension for non-standard event record trees:
- Boosting of subsequent daughters of verices treated by photos
  is now hardy for multimother splittings (that is loops in a tree)
- It is not hardy (yet) for secondary intgeractions like it case of ttbar 
  production vertex.
- Experiments default, energy momentum conservation test (printing sum of 
  all event's stable products 4-momenta), which is to be repated by users  
  (see documentation Appendix B.3) is in our demo programs now.

Apr 5 2012
- New methods for ignoring status codes:
  ignoreParticlesOfStatus
  deIgnoreParticlesOfStatus
  isStatusCodeIgnored


Apr 1 2012
  Inherited from HepMC method of momentum conservation check supplemented
  with missing so far energy. This is of importance for control of history
  entries.

Mar 24 2012
- Release 3.4
- New options useful for correcting event record Photos is supposed to act,
  resulting from interactions with users:
  forceMass
  forceMassFromEventRecord
  createHistoryEntries
- small bugfixes


Dec 10 2011
- Release 3.3 (sent to LCG for installation).
- NLO installed in all options and demos: for Z W and scalars decays.
- Cleaning of the configuration scripts and LCG scripts completed
- All tests passed. Up-to-date READMES, headers of all root benchmark files, 
  options in test programs.
- Several older benchmark files for NLO tests added for reference. Available
  for comparisons with  advanced options of test programs; options
  described in 'examples/testing/README-comparison-options'

- Example using interface without HepMC added
- To  compile without HepMC use:
  ./configure --without-hepmc

Nov 11 2011
 - Long tests with SANC at sub 0.01 % level went fine
   for single photon version of W decay at NLO, see:
   http://annapurna.ifj.edu.pl/~wasm/photosNLOtest.html
 - Maximum weight over-run for W decay localized and fixed.
 - NLO in scalar to two saclars active, but demos are missing some explanations
   and activation examples. 
 - NLO exp W decay still missing test benchmarks.

Apr 26 2011
 - NLO for W decay installed, some tests went OK, but need continuation
 - NLO in scalar to two saclars not active, but code is already in.

Mar 28 2011
- Added instalation scripts for LCG.

Dec 23 2010
- Bug resulting in NaN's on some platforms fixed
-draft of ZmumuNLO example/testing added
Dec 22 2010 
- First order NLO version checked
-numerical stability on other platforms must be verified
-version of reduction procedures remain to be re-checked as well
Dec 21 2010
- First long sample tests start to come OK, demos are not prepared.
  Note difference at 0.05 % level with respect to NLO paper from 2007.
  Different option of matching consecutive emission is used. Point will be 
  clarified later. 
- First order NLO version remain unchecked.
Dec 12 2010
- First  tests of NLO installation start to come out OK 

Dec 10 2010
- NLO option drafted into the code, no tests performed

Dec 5 2010
- Added: methods for option  complete matrix element calculation 
  (prepared in detail for Z/gamma only)
  WARNING: Implementation of matrix element for Z/gamma at work.
- Numerically insignificant fix for the bug reported by Savinov. 
   Result was that for photons of energies below .0001 of decaying particle 
   mass final state charged particles were getting unphysical mass in event 
   record.  

Nov 8 2010
- Fixed small typo in configuration help printout
