INTRODUCTION:
------------

The  RChL-currents directory should be placed as subdirectory of
TAUOLA/tauola/new-currents directory.

It contains files which need to be compiled 
and loaded with TAUOLA  to replace its native hadronic currents with 
the new ones. 

Technical details on modification for native tauola code are given
at the end of this README

Directory RChL-currents/tabler/a1 includes program used for 
calculation of numerical table(s) (tables are encapsulated in FORTRAN code
file initA1Tab.f) used by the formfactors. 

Directory RChL-currents/tabler/k0pi_scalar contains the table 
(tables are encapsulated in FORTRAN code
file initKpiScalTab.f) that is the scalar form factor used in the Kpi current. 
initKpiScalTab.f is based on absF0KPi.dat sent by M. Jamin.

Directory RChL-currents/cross-check include programs for the tests and 
the results of TAUOLA run with the RChL version for the channels, at present
for 2 and some 3 scalar modes, that means with JAK= 4,5,7,14,15,16,22

Directory RChL-currents/backup is temporary

Physics documentation is given in sub-directory  RChL-currents/paper. 
In particular detailed description of the currents is given in 
the paper, section ...


Content of all mentioned above sub-directories  is not loaded
(thus is not needed) for creation of TAUOLA library 
(to be created by makefile in TAUOLA/tauola directory). 



LIST OF FILES:
-------------

The files listed below are stored in RChL-currents directory.
On top of each file brief info is given. It includes main physics 
reference paper, our documentation chapter no and
input/output parameters.

1. f3pi_rcht.f
current for the 3pi (both \pi+\pi-\pi- and \pi0\pi0\pi-) channels

2. fkkpi.f
current for the channels K+K-pi- and K0 \bar K0 pi- 

3. fkk0pi0.f
current for the channel K0 K- pi0 


4. wid_a1_fit.f
Calculates the value \Gamma(a1->3 scalars) at the fixed Q2 interpolating
the value from the table initA1Tab.f. 
It is needed by f3pi_rcht.f  fkkpi.f fkk0pi0.f 

5. initA1Tab.f is a table used by  wid_a1_fit.f
   initA1Tab.f is a copy of the table /tabler/a1/wida1_qq_tot_2e5.out

6. frho_pi.f
current for pi- pi0 channel

7. fkpipl.f
current for both K0 pi- and K0 pi0 channels. 

8. initKpiScalTab.f
is a table with the scalar Kpi form factor. It is called in fkpipl.f
if the dipswitch FFKPISCAL is  fixed to be FFKPISCAL = 1 

9. ff_scal_kpi.f
Calculates the value of the Kpi scalar form factor for FFKPISCAL = 1 
in value_parameter.f (M. Jamin parametrization)
 at the fixed Q2 interpolating the value from the table initKpiScalTab.f.

10. fkpisc_pass.f
an adopted private code of E. Passermar for teh scalar Kpi form factor, 
it runs when  FFKPISCAL = 2

11. fk0k.f
current for K-K0 channel

12. funct_rpt.f
Functions used  in calculation  of form factors, that is  in f3pi_rcht.f,
fkkpi.f, fkk0pi0.f, frho_pi.f, fkpipl.f, fk0k.f

13. value_parameter.f 
fixes the value of dipswitches as well as the values of the model parameters
(masses and width of the resonances, constant of decays etc.). 
Numerical values of latest depend on the mode.
#####
Note:  dipswitches may affect choices for non-RChL currents as well
##### 

14. parameter.inc : declaration  masses of resonances and other parameters 
used in all above currents.

15. funct_declar.inc : declaration of the functions determined in funct_rpt.f


MODIFICATION FOR TAUOLA/tauola
------------------------------

To load the currents update only the following files of native tauola 
need to be updated:
tauola/makefile tauola/f3pi.f tauola/formf.f tauola/tauola.f .

At present  svn diff methods should be used for details. For users
help from the authors is necessary.
 
Once project reach maturity extracts from these diffs will be copied here.
