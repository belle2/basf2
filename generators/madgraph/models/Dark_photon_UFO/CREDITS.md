# Dark photon model

The files in this directory are a MadGraph model for dark photon events. The model is from **Elias Bernreuther**, **Saniya Heeba** and **Felix Kahlhoefer** in [J. Cosmol. Astropart. Phys. **2021** (2021), 40](https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2021/03/040) and [Yiming's thesis](http://graduate.physics.sunysb.edu/announ/theses/zhong-yiming-august-2016.pdf).

Permission to include these files in basf2 was generously granted on 4 November 2022 by **Felix Kahlhoefer** for the authors.

Please cite the original references for any public/published results where this model was used.
