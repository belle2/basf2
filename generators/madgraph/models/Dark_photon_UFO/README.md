# Dark photon model

The relevant parameters defined in this model are:

* `Ap`: dark photon (with PDG code 4900023);
* `DM`: Dirac fermion dark matter (with PDG code 4900101);
* `mAp`: dark photon mass;
* `mDM`: dark matter mass;
* `gDM`: coupling constant between dark photon and dark matter;
* `kappa`: kinetic mixing parameter.

See equations 2.1, 2.2 and 2.4 of the [authors' paper](https://doi.org/10.1088/1475-7516/2021/03/040) for more information about these parameters.
