# L<sub>µ</sub>-L<sub>τ</sub> Z' model

The files in this directory are a MadGraph model for lepton-non-universal Z' particles. The model files are provided by **Brian Shuve** and were developed originally for BaBar's analysis [Phys. Rev. D **94**, 011102](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.011102). The model itself is based on **Xiao-Gang He**, **Girish Joshi**, **Henry Lew**, and **Raymond Volkas** in [Phys. Rev. D **43**, R22](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.43.R22) .

Permission to include these files in basf2 was granted in March 2021 by **Brian Shuve**.

Please cite the original references for any public/published results where this model was used.
