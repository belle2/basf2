The files in this directory are a MadGraph model for dark photon events. The model is from **Rouven Essig**, **Jeremy Mardon**, **Michele Papucci**, **Tomer Volansky** and **Yiming Zhong** in [J. High Energ. Phys. **2013**, 167](https://doi.org/10.1007/JHEP11(2013)167) and [Yiming's thesis](http://graduate.physics.sunysb.edu/announ/theses/zhong-yiming-august-2016.pdf).

Permission to include these files in basf2 was generously granted on 15 February 2021 by **Yiming Zhong** for the authors.
