This directory contains the following subdirectories
    ff       -- the ff library, part of QCDLoop (see http://qcdloop.fnal.gov/)
    ql       -- the ql library, part of QCDLoop (see http://qcdloop.fnal.gov/)
    src      -- PJFry library
    eemmg5   -- e+e-mu+mu-gamma pentagons library
    eemmgisr -- e+e-mu+mu-gamma ISR library (for tests)

The Makefile.inc contains compiler settings.
You can edit it or use one of 3 predefined combinations:
    Makefile.inc.gfortran --  gcc + gfortran
    Makefile.inc.g77      --  gcc + g77
    Makefile.inc.ifort    --  icpc + ifort

For instance to use icpc + ifort one needs to replace constents of Makefile.inc
with the contents of Makefile.inc.ifort

After that, typing make should compile QCDLoop, PJFry, eemmg5 and eemmgisr libraries.
In addition two test programs are compiled test and demo. Their output can be compared
with reference output test.log and demo.log to make sure that PJFry operates correctly.

By default recommended dynamic libraries (*.so) are compiled. In that case runtime
environment should tell the loader where to find them.
For instance by setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to path to libraries.

If static libraries (*.a) are needed, one can uncomment the corresponding section
of Makefile.inc. In that case dynamic libraries will not be built.
Linking with static libraries should include -lstdc++ when linking with FORTRAN compiler.

The following FF message can appear:
     ffopen: error: could not open /lscrm/yundin/.config/ff/fferr.dat
          adjust path in ffopen (ffinit_mine.f)
     fferr:  warning cannot open fferr.dat with error texts
It can be either ignored or fixed by putting files ff/ffwarn.dat and ff/fferr.dat
to $HOME/.config/ff or $HOME/ff
