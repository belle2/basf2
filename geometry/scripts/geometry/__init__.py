    Check list of geometry components. This function is used by the standard
    scripts, for example `simulation.add_simulation()`. Thus, only the detector
    components corresponding to subdetectors are allowed. In addition, TRG is
    included.  Trigger is not a geometry component, but it is used as an
    additional component in raw-data and DQM scripts.

    If there is a unsupported component in the list the function will raise a
    FATAL error and is guaranteed to not return.

    Parameters:
        components (list(str)): List of geometry components.
