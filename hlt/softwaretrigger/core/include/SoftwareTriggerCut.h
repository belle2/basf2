      /**
       * Compile a new SoftwareTriggerCut from a cut string (by using the GeneralCut::compile function) and
       * an optional prescale factor. This together with the downloadFromDatabase function is the only possibility to
       * create a new SoftwareTriggerCut.
       * @param cut_string: The string from which the cut should be compiled. Must be in a format, the GeneralCut::compile function understands.
       * @param prescaleFactor: An optional prescale factor which will be used whenever the cut is checked.
       *        The prescale factor is a integer value. If the prescale is e.g. 10, the cut will only result in a "accept" result
       *        (although the cut condition itself is true) in 1 of 10 cases on average for accept cuts
       *        (for reject cuts, the prescale is *not* used).
       *        Defaults to 1, which means that the prescale has no impact on the cut check.
       * @param rejectCut: Turn this cut into a reject cut and not a accept cut. The result of the SoftwareTriggerModules
       *        is defined by these two cut types. See the SoftwareTriggerModule for more information. Please note that
       *        the condition is turned the other way round if it is a reject cut. See the example below.
       * @return a unique_ptr on a SoftwareTriggerCut with the given cut condition and prescale.
       *
       * To summarize: the cut has the following result:
       * * if the cut is an accept cut:
       *    * if the cut condition is true, it returns *accept* in 1 out of prescaleFactor cases
       *      and *noResult* otherwise.
       *    * if the cut condition is false, it returns *noResult*.
       * * if the cut is a reject cut:
       *    * if the cut condition is true, it returns *dismiss*.
       *    * if the cut condition is false, it returns *noResult*.
       *
       * Let us look into two examples. The first is an accept cut for gg events. It may have the following parameters:
       *
       *    cut condition = something which is only true for gg events
       *    prescaleFactor = 100
       *    rejectCut = false
       *
       * If the event is a gg event (and the cut conditions is then true), the cut will return "accept" in 1% of the cases,
       * and "noResult" in all other cases. If the event is not a gg event, the cut will always return "noResult".
       * The SoftwareTriggerModule will keep the event if this trigger results in "accept",
       * in all other cases it depends on the other loaded cuts.
       *
       * The second cut is an reject cut for ee events. It may have the following parameters:
       *
       *    cut condition = something which is only true for ee events
       *    rejectCut = true
       *    prescaleFactor will not be used
       *
       * If the event is an ee event (and the cut condition is true), the cut will result in "dismiss". In all other cases
       * it returns "noResult".
       * The SoftwareTriggerModule will not pass this event if the result is
       * "dismiss", in all other cases it depends on the other loaded cuts.
