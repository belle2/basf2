     * call the initialize function with the cuts you want to process in the module's initialize
     * method and look for changed DB entries in the beginRun function.
     *
     * In the normal event function of the module, you can get a list of cuts with their names
     * by calling the getCutsWithNames method.
     *
     * You can also upload new cuts (or new versions of cuts) with the upload function.
     *
     * In all download and upload methods, you have to provide both a base name and a specific name for the cut.
     * Both names are used (together with a package name) to construct the identifier of the cut
     * (using the getFullCutName method). You can only download cuts from the same set (defined with the same
     * base name), to not mix e.g. level3 and hlt cuts.
