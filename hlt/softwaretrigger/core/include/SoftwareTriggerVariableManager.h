     * Variable Manager for the software trigger cuts.
     * This class fulfills all the requirement of a variable manager, as stated in the GeneralCut class
     * and can (and should) therefore be used together with it, which is done in the SoftwareTriggerCut.
     *
     * The idea behind it is as follows: The SoftwareTriggerVariableManager itself does not know
     * on how to calculate your needed variables, but you as the user of the SoftwareTriggerCut
     * has to know. This gives you the opportunity to calculate them
     * differently before or after the full reconstruction (because you may not have all information
     * at hand at all time) or use temporary shared calculation objects when compiling the numbers.
     * Whenever a SoftwareTriggerCut has a variable it it and the check function asks the variable
     * manager for its value, the variable manager will collect this value from the
     * SoftwareTriggerObject (a map from std::string to double) with the given variable name. So you as
     * the user has to make sure that the needed variables can be found in the SoftwareTriggerObject,
     * that you hand in to the checkPreScaled function of the SoftwareTriggerCut.

       * In the SoftwareTrigger case, this function is really simple: Just take the needed value
       * (with the name given by the variable's name) out of the already precompiled map
