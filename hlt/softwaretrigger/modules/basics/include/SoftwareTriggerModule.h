     * Module to perform cuts on various variables in the event. The cuts can be defined
     * by elements loaded from the database. Each cut is executed and its result stored.
     *
     * The return value of this module is a bool, which is either true (accept the event) or false (reject it).
     *
     * This return value is defined by all trigger decision up to now. It is true, if the trigger stage
     * accepted the event and false in all other cases.
     *
     * The result for the triggers calculated within each module (depending on the base name):
     *
     * It is defined from the results of the cuts in the given trigger menu, which are all evaluated
     * and the trigger mode (accept mode or not).
     * if not in accept mode (= reject mode):
     * * 1: if one of the accept cuts has a true result and none of the reject cuts is false ( = accepted)
     * * 0: if neither one of the accept cuts is true nor one of the reject cuts false ( = don't know) or
     * *    if one of the reject cuts is false ( = rejected)
     *
     * In short: event accepted <=> (\#true accept cuts > 0) && (\#false reject cuts == 0)
     *
     * Please note that the reject cuts override the accept cuts decision in this case!
     *
     * if in accept mode:
     * * 1: if one of the accept cuts has a true result. ( = accepted) or
     * *    if neither one of the accept cuts is true nor one of the reject cuts false ( = don't know)
     * * 0: if one of the reject cuts is false and none of the accept cuts is true ( = rejected)
     *
     * Please note that the accept cuts override the reject cuts decision in this case!
     *
     * In short: event accepted <=> (\#true accept cuts > 0) || (\#false reject cuts == 0)
