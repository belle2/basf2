    Add all modules, conditions and conditional paths to the given path, that are needed for a full
    reconstruction stack in the HLT using the software trigger modules.

    If the trigger is turned on (softwaretrigger_mode = filter), all events that are dismissed
    by the trigger module are removed from the datastore - except the event meta data
    and the software trigger result.
    All accepted events also go through the "skim" path, where additional skimming results are calculated.

    If the trigger is turned off, both trigger and skimming results are calculated but no events are dismissed.

    Before calling this function, make sure that your database setup is suited to download software trigger cuts
    from the database (local or global) and that you unpacked raw data in your data store (e.g. call the add_unpacker
    function) and the geometry is setup.
    After this part of the reconstruction is processes, you rather want to store the output, as you can not
    do anything sensible any more (all the information of the reconstruction is lost).

    :param path: The path to which the ST modules will be added.
    :param store_array_debug_prescale: Set to an finite value, to control for how many events the variables should
        be written out to the data store.
    :param components: the detector components to do reconstruction on
    :param softwaretrigger_mode: which mode (filter/monitor) the trigger should have
