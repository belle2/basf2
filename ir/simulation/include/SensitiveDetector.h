     * The IR Sensitive Detector class.
     *
     * This class stores Geant4 steps (pieces of tracks) in the IR acitve sensors
     * to IRSimHits. The steps are not aggregated and are intended to be directly
     * digitized. The IRSimHits are saved in a DataStore collection together with their
     * relations to MCParticles (actually, the relations are indexed by trackIDs rather than
     * MCParticles, the relations to MCParticles are later restored by the framework.
     *
     * The threshold parameter defines minimum energy that a Geant4 step has to deposit to be saved in
     * the DataStore. It is a dimensionless number defining the fraction of a MIP deposition per unit
     * path length.
     *
     * Detection of photons. The original version only stores hits from charged tracks, meaning
     * that only pair production is taken into account for photons. In this version, also
     * photoeffect and Compton scattering are taken into account.
     *
     * Based on the implementation of the Mokka VXD sensitive detector class.
