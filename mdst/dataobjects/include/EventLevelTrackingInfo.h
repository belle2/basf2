   *  - a large number of unassigned measurements can be a hint for unreconstructed charged particles;
   *  - a check, if background conditions are similar to e.g. off-resonance data etc. is possible;
   *  - possibly further merging, clone-removal, resolution estimation depending on this info may make sense;
   *
   *  Additionally, setters and getters for hints of track finding failure during an event are included in this object.
   *  If we have a reason to assume, that there was a track in the event, that we didn't find or the
   *  track finding process was affected in any way we set a flag, respectively, that might be useful for veto purposes.
   *  The covered causes for a failure coded in the member bitset m_flagBlock can be identified via the
   *  TrackingErrorFlags enum.
