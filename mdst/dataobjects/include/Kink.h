     *
     * 2nd and 3rd digits for filter 1-6 of `KinkFinderModule` represent the result of combined fit (from 0 to 15, 18 and 19);
     * 19 means fit of combined track is failed; 18 means combined track has less n.d.f. than mother track;
     * if <16, it should be understood in bit form, where the results of following comparisons are 1 or 0:
     * 1st bit: p-value of combined fit > p-value of mother fit; 2nd bit: p-value of combined fit > p-value of daughter fit;
     * 3rd bit: n.d.f. of combined track > n.d.f. daughter track; 4th bit: p-value of combined fit > 10^{âˆ’7}.
     *
     * 2nd digit for filter 7-9 of `KinkFinderModule` shows 1 (0) if the distance at the fitted vertex is bigger (smaller)
     * than required cut in `KinkFitter`.
     *
     * 4th and 5th digits together form a number of reassigned hits (from 0 to 32);

     * @example -23181: -2318"1" track pair was preselected with filter 1, 2, 4, or 5
     * (mother track and daughter track end points are close); -23"18"1 the exit code of combined fit is 18, so
     * the combined track has less n.d.f. than mother track; "-23"181 -- 23 hits were reassigned from daughter track
     * to mother track
     * @example 2015: 201"5" kink was created from split track selected with filter 9 (track did not pass
     * neither mother nor daughter preselection criteria); 2"01"5 the code 1 means that the distance at the fitted
     * kink vertex is larger than the set cut; "2"015 -- 2 hits were reassigned from mother track to daughter track
