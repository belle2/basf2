     *  the Track rather than the TrackFitResult is the place to store this information.
     *  We don't want to provide a default cut, because charged-particle-vetos and
     *  recombination of different kind of resonances potentially can profit from different
     *  working points on the efficiency-purity curve, and we expect some MC-data discrepancy due
     *  to imperfect calibration of the local reconstruction inputs.
