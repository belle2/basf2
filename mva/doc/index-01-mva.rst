MVA package
===========

Documentation about the MVA package migrated from our `confluence page <https://confluence.desy.de/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35833547>`_. Please go there.
If you have time to do the migration, feel free to take `agira ticket <https://agira.desy.de/browse/BII-3547>`_. In this case you might need nice guid on Sphinx documentation: :ref:`doctools` .
