Changes in the mva package since release-07-00
----------------------------------------------
* Added support of decay string functionality to ``MVAExpert`` module, so it can be used for daughter particles. 
* Updated the argument ``overwriteExistingExtraInfo`` of ``MVAExpert`` and ``MVAMultipleExperts`` modules so that
  one can more flexibly choose to keep or overwrite existing information. Instead of a boolean users should now
  pass one of (-1/0/1/2). An existing extra info with the same name will be overwritten if the new value is
  lower / will never be overwritten / will be overwritten if the new value is higher / will always be overwritten (option = -1/0/1/2).
