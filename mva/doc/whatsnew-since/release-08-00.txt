Changes in the mva package since release-08-00
----------------------------------------------

* Added an interface for pyTorch. Please see ``mva/examples/torch/simple.py`` for a basic example for binary
  classification. As with all other supported python interfaces the interface is designed for users to override the
  ``get_model(...)``, ``begin_fit(...)``, ``partial_fit(...)``, and ``apply(...)`` methods in their training script to
  define their models and training loop as needed.
* With ``externals v02-02-01`` we moved to ``tensorflow v2.16`` which contains ``keras v3``. The ``keras`` interface and
  examples have been updated to use this new version. The new interface is not backwards compatible for weightfiles
  created with the previous interface.
