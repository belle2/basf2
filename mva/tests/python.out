[WARNING] String passed to makeROOTCompatible contains double-underscore __, which is used internally for escaping special characters. It is recommended to avoid this. However escaping a string twice with makeROOTCompatible is safe, but will print this warning. Passed string: Python__ptxml_isSignal  { module:  }
