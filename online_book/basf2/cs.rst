Introduction
------------

Most e\ :sup:`+` e\ :sup:`-` interactions at Belle II do not result in a ϒ(4S) resonance
which then decays to two B mesons.

Of these non-ϒ(4S) events, those resulting in some state without hadrons are usually not problematic in analyses
looking for B decays as they are already rejected by the trigger.

Continuum events are more problematic. B meson candidates reconstructed from these decays show a broad distribution
in variables such as the beam-constrained mass which makes them difficult to separate and suppress
when extracting a signal component.

.. admonition:: Question
    :class: exercise stacked

    Do you still remember what continuum is?

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Have a look back in :ref:`backgrounds` where this is introduced.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    When we talk about continuum, we mean events with the process e\ :sup:`+` e\ :sup:`-` → qq,
    i.e. directly to some lighter hadrons without creating a ϒ(4S) resonance.

    In Belle II Monte Carlo, the centrally produced continuum samples are separated by their quark content and are
    called ``uubar``, ``ddbar``, ``ssbar``, and ``ccbar``.

If variables which you already know from the previous exercises are bad at separating continuum and
BB events, which other properties of the events can we use?
The answer is the overall **shape** of the events, i.e. the momentum-weighted distribution of all particles in the
detector.

.. admonition:: Question
    :class: exercise stacked

    Which of these two pictures better represents the distribution (shape) of particles you would expect in a BB event?
    Which represents a continuum event?

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Think about the different masses of the Continuum hadrons compared to B mesons. How does this reflect in the
    momentum?

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    The continuum particles are strongly collimated due to the large available momentum for the decay to light hadrons.
    In contrast, the particles from the BB event are uniformly distributed.

So how do we get access to the event shape? We construct B candidates and then create a Rest of Event for them.
This allows us to study the entire event and compute shape properties,
while taking into account which particles belong to our signal reconstruction.

.. warning::

    In addition to the :ref:`analysis_continuumsuppression` tools that
    we will be using in this exercise, there is also the :ref:`analysis_eventshape` framework in
    basf2 which calculates similar properties to the Continuum Suppression module.
    However, this does not use candidate-based analysis and is not designed for Continuum Suppression.

    Always make sure the variables you're using in the exercise are from the Continuum Suppression module and not the
    similarly-named ones from the Event Shape Framework.

Which properties can we use?
A popular one is the ratio of the second and zeroth Fox-Wolfram moment:

.. math::

    R_2 = \frac{H_2}{H_0}

This variable is called `R2` in basf2 (not to be confused with `foxWolframR2` which is the same property
but from the Event Shape Framework).

Fox-Wolfram moments are rotationally-invariant parametrisations of the distribution of particles in an event.
They are defined by

.. math::

    H_l = \sum_{i,j} \frac{\lvert p_i \rvert \lvert p_j \rvert }{E^2_{\text{event}}} P_l(\cos{\theta_{i, j}})

with the momenta p :sub:`i,j`, the angle θ :sub:`i,j` between them, the total energy in the event
E :sub:`event` and the Legendre Polynomials P :sub:`l`.

Other powerful properties are those based on the thrust vector. This is the vector along which the total projection
of a collection of momenta is maximised. This collection of momenta can be the B candidate or the rest of event.

The cosine of the angle between both thrust vectors, `cosTBTO` in basf2, is a thrust-based discriminating variable.
In BB events, the particles are almost at rest and so the thrust vectors are uniformly distributed. Therefore,
`cosTBTO` will also be uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.
In qq events, the particles are collimated and the thrust axes point back-to-back, leading to a peak at high values of
`cosTBTO`.
A similar argument can be made for the angle of the thrust axis with the beam axis which is `cosTBz` in basf2.

In addition to the angular quantities, basf2 also provides the total thrust magnitude of both the B candidate `thrustBm`
and the ROE `thrustOm`. Depending on the signal process, these can also provide some discriminating power.

If you would like to know more, Chapter 9 of `The Physics of the B Factories book <https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6311>`_
has an extensive overview over these quantities.


.. admonition:: Question
    :class: exercise stacked

    Can you find out which other variables are provided by basf2 for continuum suppression?

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Check the Continuum Suppression variable group in :ref:`analysis_variables`.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    In addition to the five variables

    * `R2`
    * `cosTBTO`
    * `cosTBz`
    * `thrustBm`
    * `thrustOm`

    mentioned above, basf2 also provides "CLEO cones" (`CleoConeCS`) and
    "Kakuno-Super-Fox-Wolfram" variables (`KSFWVariables`). These are more complex engineered variables and
    are mostly used with machine learning methods.

First Continuum Suppression steps in basf2
------------------------------------------

Now, how do we access the shape of events in basf2?

First we need some data. In this exercise we will use two samples, one with "uubar" continuum background and one
with :math:`B^0 \to K_S^0 \pi^0` decays. These samples are called ``uubar_sample.root`` and
``B02ks0pi0_sample.root`` and can be used with the `basf2.find_file` function
(you need the ``data_type='examples'`` switch and also have to prepend ``starterkit/2021/`` to the filename).
If this doesn't work you can find the files in ``/sw/belle2/examples-data/starterkit/2021`` on KEKCC.


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Load the mdst files mentioned above, then reconstruct Kshort candidates from two charged pions.
    Load the charged pions with the cut ``'chiProb > 0.001 and pionID > 0.5'`` and combine only pions whose combined
    invariant mass is within 36 MeV of the neutral kaon mass (498 MeV).
    We won't be using the Kshorts from the `stdV0s` package as these are always vertex fit which we don't need.

    Then, load some neutral pion candidates from `stdPi0s` and combine them with the Kshort candidates to
    B0 candidates. Only create B0 candidates with `Mbc` between 5.1 GeV and 5.3 GeV and `deltaE`
    between -2 GeV and 2 GeV.

    These cuts are quite loose but this way you will be able to reconstruct B0 candidates from continuum events without
    processing large amounts of continuum Monte Carlo.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/090_cs.py
        :language: python
        :end-at: E13


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Now, create a Rest of Event for the B0 candidates and append a mask with the track cuts
    ``'nCDCHits > 0 and useCMSFrame(p)<=3.2'`` and the cluster cuts ``'p >= 0.05 and useCMSFrame(p)<=3.2'`` to it.
    These cuts are common choices for continuum suppression, however they might not be the best ones for your analysis
    later on!

    Then, adding the continuum suppression module is just a single call to the
    `modularAnalysis.buildContinuumSuppression` function. You have to pass the name of the ROE mask you've just created
    to the function.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    You can use `modularAnalysis.appendROEMasks` to add the mask.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/090_cs.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S10
        :end-at: E10


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Now you can write out a few event shape properties. Use the five properties mentioned above. To evaluate the
    performance of these variables, add the truth-variable `isContinuumEvent`.

    You can also add the beam-constrained mass `Mbc` which you should know from previous exercises to see the uniform
    background component in this variable.

    Then, process the path and run the steering file!

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/090_cs.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S20
        :end-at: E20

Now that we have created our ntuple, we can look at the data and see how well the variables suppress continuum.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Plot the distributions of R2 from 0 to 1 for both continuum and signal components as
    determined by `isContinuumEvent`.

    Where would you put the cut when trying to retain as much signal as possible?

    If you want you can also plot the other four variables and see how their performance compares.


.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Use ``histtype='step'`` when plotting with matplotlib, this makes it easier to see the difference between the two
    distributions.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: cs/plotting_R2.py
        :language: python

    Your plot should look similar to this:

    .. figure:: cs/R2_uubar.png
        :width: 40em
        :align: center

    Judging by this plot, a cut at R2 = 0.4 would provide good separation. Of course, this can change if you employ cuts
    on other CS variables too!

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    In the previous exercise we have used a ``uubar`` sample as our continuum sample. How would you expect the
    distribution in `R2` to change when we switch this out with a ``ccbar`` sample? Think about this for a bit,
    then try it! You can use the file ``ccbar_sample.root`` in the starterkit folder.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    The separation becomes worse as the charmed hadrons are heavier and have less momentum:

    .. figure:: cs/R2_ccbar.png
        :width: 40em
        :align: center

So how do we separate our signal component from continuum background in the presence of all types of continuum? As you
have seen with the five variables we have introduced so far, none of them can provide perfect separation.
Fortunately, there is a solution to this: Boosted Decision Trees!

.. _online_book_cs_bdt:

Continuum suppression using Boosted Decision Trees
--------------------------------------------------

Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) are a specific type of a machine learning model
used for classification tasks. In this lesson we try to classify all candidates as
either continuum or not continuum.

The name *decision tree* refers to the general structure: the classification is
done with a series of "decisions". Decisions are logical operations (like ">",
"<", "=", etc.) on the input variables of each data point, by the outcome of
which the data points are separated into groups. Each outcome has a separate
line of decisions following it. The maximum number of such decisions is called the
"tree depth".

The word *boosted* refers to the specific way the tree is formed: gradient
boosting. Gradient boosting means, that a final tree is made by combining a
series of smaller trees of a fixed depth.

.. seealso:: The reader is welcome to consult the Wikipedia pages on `Decision
    Tree Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning>`_ and
    `Gradient Tree Boosting
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Gradient_tree_boosting>`_
    for a more detailed overview. For details on ``FastBDT``, the implementation used at
    at Belle II take a look at this `article
    <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41781-017-0002-8>`_. The
    source code can be found `here <https://github.com/thomaskeck/FastBDT/>`_.

The output of the BDT  is the "continuum probability" -- the
probability of an event being a continuum event, as estimated based on the input variables. The input variables can be in
principle any variable that looks different between continuum and non-continuum
events. The recommended and most commonly used variables are the ones introduced in
the previous lesson as well as others from the *Continuum Suppression* variable group in
the :ref:`analysis_variables`.

The BDT is a supervised machine learning method, i.e. it needs to be trained on a
dataset where we know the true class that we are trying to predict (this variable
is called the *target variable*). Thus the
steps are

1. Create a learning dataset (Monte Carlo data)
2. Make the algorithm "learn" and output a decision tree that we can use.
3. Apply the trained decision tree to both Monte Carlo and real data.

In the last step, the BDT will return the continuum
probability, which then can be stored in the Ntuples. To actually remove
continuum events, simply add a cut on the continuum probability at the end.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    In the three initial exercises of this chapter you've learned how to create
    Ntuples for continuum suppression. We only need some more variables
    this time.

    Create the dataset following the procedure from previous exercises,
    but also include KSFW moments and CLEO cones
    into the Ntuples.

    Use only the first half of the events for creating these Ntuples.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Use the code from the previous exercises. Add
    the new variables to the ``simpleCSVariables`` list. See the documentation on the
    variables in :ref:`analysis/doc/ContinuumSuppression:Continuum suppression`.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    The files *uubar_sample.root* and *B02ks0pi0_sample.root* consist of 2000
    and 30000 events respectively. You can choose half for each by using the
    ``entrySequences`` option in the ``inputMdstList`` function. See the
    documentation at :ref:`mawrappers`.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/091_cs.py
       :language: python


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Let us now create the script to train the BDT using the Ntuples that we've just
    created. The training tools are implemented in basf2 within the
    :ref:`mva/doc/index-01-mva:MVA package`. One needs to configure the global
    options and then perform the training (see :ref:`mva/doc/index-01-mva:globaloptions`
    and :ref:`mva/doc/index-01-mva:Fitting / How to perform a training`
    respectively). Using the examples given in the links write down the script
    to perform the training.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    The training script does not require creating a basf2 path and hence has no
    ``basf2.process()`` at the end. The script is sufficient when the
    ``basf2_mva.teacher()`` is defined.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Use the general options example from the documentation. Make sure to set
    ``m_datafiles`` (the Ntuple we created), ``m_target_variable`` (what are we trying
    to predict?) and
    ``m_variables`` (the training variables) to the appropriate
    values.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    We are trying to predict ``isContinuumEvent`` using all the variables from
    ``simpleCSVariables``.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/092_cs.py
                :language: python

To use the trained weights, we need to use the MVA-expert module after building
the continuum suppression in the main steering file. In our case this looks
like this:

.. code-block:: python

    path.add_module(
         "MVAExpert",
         listNames=["B0"],
         extraInfoName="ContinuumProbability",
         identifier="MVAFastBDT.root"  # <-- the BDT training that we just performed
    )

This creates the variable ``extraInfo(ContinuumProbability)``, which
should be added as an output variable to the Ntuples. To actually suppress continuum
we put a cut on the ``extraInfo(ContinuumProbability)``
in the very same way that we previously did a cut on R2 in previous exercise.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Create a steering file that runs over the data and writes the continuum
    probability into the Ntuples. Use the data files and reconstruction from the
    previous exercises.

    Use the second half of the data from the datafiles.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Use the steering file from the previous exercises, just with the ``path.add_module("MVAExpert", ...)``
    added at the end. Don't forget to change ``path`` to ``main`` or
    whatever is the name of your basf2 path.

    We recommend to add aliases to your variables. For example ``ContProb`` for
    ``extraInfo(ContinuumProbability)``.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    In case you've forgotten, the files ``B02ks0pi0_sample.root`` and ``uubar_sample.root``
    consist of 2000 and 30000 events respectively. You can choose half for each
    by using the ``entrySequences`` option in the ``inputMdstList`` function.
    See the documentation at :ref:`mawrappers`.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/093_cs.py
        :language: python

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Plot the distribution of the ``extraInfo(ContinuumProbability)``
    for continuum and non-continuum events, as defined by the `isContinuumEvent`
    (similarly to what was done before with :b2:var:`R2`).

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Use the plotting script from the previous exercises,
    but with the `R2` being replaced with the continuum probability.

    To find out the right column name for the continuum probability, you can
    always check ``print(<yourdataframename>.columns)``.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: cs/plotting.py
        :language: python

    The resulting plot should look similar to this one:

    .. figure:: cs/ContinuumProbability_uubar.png
        :width: 40em
        :align: center

The MVA package also has a built-in tool named ``basf2_mva_evaluate.py`` that
produces several useful graphs that characterise the
performance of your MVA. You can find its description at the :ref:`mva` page.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Use the MVA evaluation function to create plots characterizing your MVA training.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    Run

    .. code-block:: python

        basf2_mva_evaluate.py -id MVAFastBDT.root \
            -train ContinuumSuppression.root \
            -data ContinuumSuppression_applied.root \
            -o evaluate.zip

    This creates ``evaluate.zip`` that can be unzipped with
    with ``unzip evaluate.zip``.
    Inside you will find the plots in pdf format and a ``latex.tex`` file that
    can be used to compile a single pdf that includes all the plots (see next
    exercise)

.. warning:: For the evaluation to be possible, both test and training datasets
    have to include all the variables that were used in the BDT training.

.. admonition:: Exercise (optional)
    :class: exercise stacked

    If you have a running Tex distribution on your local machine, you can also
    generate a PDF report that includes all the plots.
    Note that you might have to install some additional
    LaTeX packages first. To generate the PDF, compile the ``latex.tex`` file from
    the ``evaluate.zip`` archive with a ``pdflatex``.

    There is also an option to create a pdf file straight ahead if you happen to
    have a ``basf2`` installation AND all the necessary LaTeX packages on the same
    machine. For that you can add a ``-c`` option and run:

    .. code-block:: python

        basf2_mva_evaluate.py -id MVAFastBDT.root \
            -train ContinuumSuppression.root \
            -data ContinuumSuppression_applied.root \
            -c -o evaluate.pdf


.. seealso:: The MVA package has many more features. You are welcome
    to read more about them at :ref:`mva` and also consult the
    literature listed at the end of that page.


Normally in an analysis, a small subset of the dataset is used to train the BDT.
The training dataset should be large enough for the performance on the trained data and testing
data (the MC data that isn't used for training) to be roughly the same.
Once this is achieved, the trained
BDT is used further on in the analysis to apply the continuum suppression.

In some few exceptions, only a loose R2 cut is used rather than training a BDT
(e.g. in this `Belle II paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08819>`_).
This might be done for practical reasons such as dealing with a low amount of data.

Also keep in mind that using a BDT (with several selection variables) increases the dependence on your
MC modeling (real data might behave differently for some of these variables than in MC simulation),
so you might have to give an uncertainty and possibly make corrections.
If a cut on `R2` separates continuum good enough, then you only have to make sure there is good agreement between
data and MC on this variable, but if you use 30 variables in a BDT you will have to check all 30 at some point.
