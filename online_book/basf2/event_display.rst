A well-deserved pause
---------------------

In the last six lessons you built up a realistic steering file step by step.
Congratulations for making it to this point! üç∞

You probably already have developed quite a nice feeling for how to work with
basf2. There is much more to learn, but the remaining topics are more
specialized and might not apply to every analysis.

All of the following lessons (from here out) are largely self-contained and
only have prerequisites that you have already done. You can pick and choose
whatever you find interesting, or whatever you think you will need.

For now though, you might be a bit tired of the whole business of steering
files. So how about something a bit more visual and fun?


Meet the Belle II event display
-------------------------------

Head over to the :ref:`display` documentation pages. Take a look at the
event display for the mdst file that you were looking at in these last lessons
(you might need a bit of patience if you're using xforwarding).

        Can you identify a :math:`B\to J/\psi K_S` event?
