    **Teaching**: 10 min

    **Exercises**: 30 min (including processing)

    **Prerequisites**:

    * Lessons 1-2

    **Questions**:

    * What are tagged analyses?
    * How can I reconstruct a generic B meson?
    * How can I use information from **both** B mesons for my analysis?

    **Objectives**:

    * Learn how to use the FEI in your steering file
    * Understand the output from the FEI


Introduction
------------

In each ϒ(4S) decay at Belle II, two B mesons are produced. If one of the B mesons decays to a final
state involving neutrinos, this B meson cannot be reconstructed completely as the neutrinos are invisible to the detector.
The information can, however, be recovered from the second B meson. This is called **tagging**,
the second B meson is referred to as B\ :sub:`tag`. The Full Event Interpretation (FEI; pronounced like phi)
is an algorithm which reconstructs this B\ :sub:`tag` in roughly 10 000 channels.
It uses a hierarchical approach to do so, first reconstructing low-level particles such as Kaons and Pions,
then intermediate D mesons and finally B mesons. At each stage, the most-likely particle candidates are selected using
multivariate classifiers and then used for the next stage. Usually, we do not have to train these classifiers ourselves as
this requires large computing resources. Instead, the classifiers are pre-trained and can be loaded from a central database.

Fortunately, for you as a user this is all contained within a few lines of code, allowing you to easily include the FEI
in your steering file.
In the first part of this exercise, we will use the FEI to reconstruct a  B\ :sup:`+`\ :sub:`tag` and have a look at its
properties. In the second part we will combine the B\ :sub:`tag` with a B meson reconstructed in a decay channel
involving neutrinos, referred to as B\ :sub:`sig`.


.. admonition:: Exercise
     :class: exercise stacked

     Find the documentation of the FEI and look up "hadronic tagging" and
     "semileptonic tagging".
     What is the difference between both analysis strategies? What are advantages and disadvantages?

.. admonition:: Hint
     :class: toggle xhint stacked

     The documentation can be found in the :ref:`analysis/doc/AdvancedTopics:Advanced Topics` section of the analysis module.
     The definitions can be found in the section titled ``Hadronic, Semileptonic and Inclusive Tagging``.

.. admonition:: Solution
     :class: toggle solution

     The documentation is here: `FullEventInterpretation`

     Hadronic tagging uses only B meson decays without neutrinos and is therefore more precise
     (as the exact momentum of the B meson can be known).

     Semileptonic tagging uses decays that include one neutrino,
     these have higher branching fractions but are less precise as the kinematic information is incomplete.

In this exercise we will use hadronic tagging, the procedure for semileptonic tagging is analogous but as it is less
commonly used it is not discussed in this exercise.


Reconstructing a B\ :sup:`+`\ :sub:`tag`
----------------------------------------

Prerequisites
*************

As usual, we start our steering file by importing the  necessary python packages,
creating a basf2 path and loading input data.
In addition to the usual python packages (``basf2`` and `modularAnalysis`) we also import the ``fei`` package.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Import ``basf2``, ``modularAnalysis`` and ``fei``.
    In addition, we will be using variable aliases so be sure to import the variable manager.
    Then create a path and
    load input data from an ``mdst`` file.

    You can again use mdst files from ``${BELLE2_EXAMPLES_DATA_DIR}/starterkit/2021``.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :end-at: E13

Now we need the Global Tag in which the weight files for the FEI can be found. This can change once a new central
training of the FEI is released, so please check the recommended versions.
One way to do so is to use the `b2conditionsdb-recommend<b2conditionsdb-recommend>` tool
with the mdst file as argument.
But there is also a handy method in the `modularAnalysis` package. Can you find it?

The correct Global Tag must then be used in your steering file by prepending it
to the `conditions.globaltags <ConditionsConfiguration.globaltags>` list in the ``basf2`` namespace.
There is also a convenience function for that!

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Include the recommended Global Tag in your steering file. For this you need to
    get the recommended tag using a method found in `modularAnalysis` and then
    prepend it to the list using a function documented at :ref:`conditionsdb_overview`.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    You can get the recommended tag using `modularAnalysis.getAnalysisGlobaltag`

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    The function to prepend to the list of global tags is `conditions.prepend_globaltag <ConditionsConfiguration.prepend_globaltag>`.
    Now combine this with the last hint!

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    Include it in the steering file like this:

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S23
        :end-at: E23


Configuring the FEI
*******************

Now that all the prerequisites are there, we have to configure the FEI for our purposes. To do this,
we need to configure two objects:
The `fei.get_default_channels` function and the `fei.FeiConfiguration` object.

The `fei.get_default_channels` function controls which channels the FEI reconstructs. Disabling channels speeds up the FEI
so it makes sense to only select what you need by specifying the appropriate arguments.
As only charged B mesons are reconstructed in this exercise, the ``chargedB`` argument has to be set to True (default)
and the ``neutralB`` argument to False.
The same applies to the ``hadronic`` and ``semileptonic`` arguments, set ``hadronic=True`` and ``semileptonic=False``
as you will only reconstruct B mesons in hadronic decay channels.

B meson decay channels involving baryons are a rather new feature that increase efficiency. They are turned on by
default and can be controlled with the argument ``baryonic``.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Configure `fei.get_default_channels` as described above and assign it to a variable.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S10
        :end-at: E10


The `fei.FeiConfiguration` class controls the other configuration options of the FEI.
Here, the FEI monitoring should be disabled with the appropriate argument (``monitor=False``) as we are not interested in
the internal performance characteristics of the FEI stages.
We also have to specify the FEI prefix argument here. This prefix allows distinguishing between different trainings
in a single Global Tag and is ``prefix=FEIv4_2021_MC14_release_05_01_12`` for the current central training.


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Configure `fei.FeiConfiguration` as described above and assign it to a variable.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S20
        :end-at: E20

The configuration created above must now be turned into a ``basf2`` path which can be appended to the main path.
This is done with the `fei.get_path` function which takes the channel configuration
and the general FEI configuration as arguments and returns a `FeiState <fei.core.FeiState>` object.
The ``path`` attribute of this newly-created `FeiState  <fei.core.FeiState>` (e.g. ``feistate.path``) is then appended
to the main path with the `basf2.Path.add_path` method.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Create the FEI path with `fei.get_path()` and use its `basf2.Path.add_path`
    method to add it to your main path.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    The syntax is ``mainpath.add_path(feipath)``.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S30
        :end-at: E30


You have now successfully added the FEI to the main path. The FEI will add a particle list
to the datastore called ``B+:generic``. In addition to the usual variables, the B meson candidates in the particle list
will also have two ``extraInfo`` variables set:
The ``extraInfo(decayModeID)`` and the ``extraInfo(SignalProbability)`` variables. The first one specifies the decay
channel in which the B meson has been reconstructed, the second one is the output of the B meson classifier. This value
can be used to select B meson candidates to which the FEI assigns a higher probability.

Final Steps
***********

What remains now is adding Monte Carlo matching and creating variable aliases for the ``extraInfo``\ s
created by the FEI. Then, you can write the ``B+:generic`` list to a ``.root`` file.
You should already be familiar with these topics from the previous exercises.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Add MC matching to the ``B+:generic`` particle list and create variable aliases
    for ``extraInfo(decayModeID)`` and ``extraInfo(SignalProbability)``.

    Then, write out the ``B+:generic`` particle list to a ``root`` file.
    Interesting variables are `Mbc`, `deltaE`,
    ``extraInfo(decayModeID)``, ``extraInfo(SignalProbability)`` and `isSignal` (or their aliases).

    Finally, start the event loop with a call to `basf2.process`.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Go back to :ref:`onlinebook_first_steering_file` to see the step-by-step instructions on how to add MC matching,
    write the ntuple and start the event loop.

    Aliases are introduced in :ref:`onlinebook_various_additions`, check there if you are unsure how to use them.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    MC matching:

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S40
        :end-at: E40

    Alias creation and output (leave out the line with ``FEIProbRank``, this gets defined in the next
    exercise):

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S41
        :end-at: E41

The FEI returns not only one B meson candidate for each event but up to 20. Using the `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest`
function, it is possible to rank the candidates by the B meson classifier output in the
``extraInfo(SignalProbability)`` variable. This is optional but often useful to select the best, i.e. most likely correct,
candidate.

.. admonition:: Exercise (optional)
    :class: exercise stacked

    Use ``rankByHighest`` to rank the B meson candidates in the ``B+:generic`` list by the
    ``extraInfo(SignalProbability)`` variable. Write the rank to a new variable called ``FEIProbabilityRank``.

    Don't forget to create an alias for this variable (within an ``extraInfo`` metavariable) and write this to the
    nTuple.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    You should already be familiar with Best Candidate Selection from the :ref:`onlinebook_various_additions` lesson.
    The documentation on ``rankByHighest`` can be found here: `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest`.

    If the ``outputVariable`` argument of `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest` is called ``FEIProbabilityRank``,
    the alias should be created for ``extraInfo(FEIProbabilityRank)``.

        :language: python
        :start-at: S50
        :end-at: E50

You can now execute your steering file which should look somewhat like this:

.. admonition:: Final steering file
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/070_fei.py
        :language: python



Offline analysis
****************

Now that you have created your ntuple, we can have a look at the properties of the B mesons we have created.

You have already looked at the beam-constrained mass ``Mbc`` in :ref:`onlinebook_first_steering_file`.
For correctly reconstructed B mesons, this variable should peak at the B meson mass. It is therefore a good
indicator for the quality of the B mesons we have reconstructed.


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Load your ntuple file into python, either using ``root_pandas`` or ``uproot``.
    The latter is strongly recommended since ``root_pandas`` is deprecated and unmaintained.
    For instructions on the basic usage of ``uproot`` see the `Getting started guide <https://uproot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic.html>`_.
    After loading your ntuple, plot the distribution of `Mbc` from 5.15 -- 5.3 GeV.

    You should see broad peak with a sharp drop-off below 5.2 GeV.
    This drop-off is caused by a fixed pre-cut in the FEI. Candidates below this threshold are rejected before
    classification as they are almost always incorrect.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. code-block:: python

        # Include this only if running in a Jupyter notebook
        %matplotlib inline

        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import uproot
        
        # To load a root tree with uproot.open, the argument has to be in the form 'filename:treename'
        df = uproot.open('B_charged_hadronic.root:variables').arrays(['Mbc'], library='pd')

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        n, bins, patches = ax.hist(df['Mbc'], bins=30, range=(5.15, 5.3))
        ax.set_xlabel(r'$\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{bc}}$ in GeV/c$^2$')
        ax.set_ylabel('Number of candidates')
        fig.savefig('m_bc.pdf')

    .. figure:: fei/m_bc.png
        :width: 40em
        :align: center

.. admonition:: Question
    :class: exercise stacked

    The distribution of `Mbc` you have just plotted doesn't peak at the B meson mass of 5.28 GeV. Can you explain this?

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    We haven't really used the classifier output of the FEI yet. The up to 20 candidates in each event are selected by
    FEI Signal Probability but many still have low absolute classifier values and by definition almost all of them are
    misreconstructed.


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Increase the signal purity by requiring minimum values of ``extraInfo__boSignalProbability__bc``. Try cuts at 0.001,
    0.01 and 0.1!

    You can also try selecting the candidate with the highest FEI Probability in each event by using the
    ``extraInfo__boFEIProbabilityRank__bc`` variable created with `modularAnalysis.rankByHighest`
    (if you have done this).

    These selections should increase the purity of the B meson candidates under consideration and lead to a sharper
    peak at the B mass.

    You can also have a look at the correctly reconstructed B mesons by requiring ``isSignal == 1``. By comparing this
    to the cuts on the FEI classifier you can see how well the FEI identifies correctly reconstructed B mesons.


.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. code-block:: python

        # Include this only if running in a Jupyter notebook

        df = uproot.open('B_charged_hadronic.root:variables').arrays(['Mbc', 'SigProb', 'FEIProbRank'], library='pd')

        fig, ax = plt.subplots()

        # If you didn't do the optional exercise, the 'FEIProbRank' column won't be there.
        # Just remove this part of the query in this case.
        sig_prob_cut_df = df.query('(SigProb > 0.01) & (FEIProbRank == 1)')

Congratulations, you have now discovered the B meson in Monte Carlo data!
This concludes the first part of this lesson. The second part of this lesson will show you now how to use
the reconstructed B\ :sub:`tag` in your own analysis.


Reconstructing the full ϒ(4S) event
-----------------------------------

In this part of the lesson, we will reconstruct the full ϒ(4S) event using the FEI. The B\ :sup:`0` decay
process we will be looking at is the semileptonic decay to a charged pion, a muon and a muon neutrino.

The FEI skim
************

You might have noticed that applying the FEI takes some time, even for the small file we have just processed.
For this reason and to save computing resources, datasets with pre-applied FEI tagging exist. These
preprocessed datasets are called *skims*.

We will be using a FEI-skimmed file in this exercise in which the ``B0:generic`` particle list already exists.
If you would like to know more about skimming, you can have a look into :ref:`onlinebook_skim`.

The input file we will be using, found at ``${BELLE2_EXAMPLES_DATA_DIR}/starterkit/2021/fei_skimmed_xulnu.udst.root``, only
contains decays of B0 mesons to a light lepton and a charged pi or rho meson. This way we don't have to process
as much data as we would have to for a  file containing decays in all B decay channels.

Prerequisites (part 2)
**********************

Lets get started with the usual steps. Nothing here should be new to you.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Start a new steering file.
    In this file, you won't need the ``fei`` package so you can skip this import.
    Create a path and load the udst file
    ``${BELLE2_EXAMPLES_DATA_DIR}/starterkit/2021/fei_skimmed_xulnu.udst.root``.

    **NOTE**: You can still use `modularAnalysis.inputMdst` to do this, even though it's a ``udst`` file.

    Then, fill two particle lists with muons and charged pions. For the muons, you can require a `muonID`
    above 0.9, for the pions a `pionID` above 0.5.
    For both you should apply some requirements on the track, you can use
    ``dr < 0.5 and abs(dz) < 2 and nCDCHits > 20 and thetaInCDCAcceptance``

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    You should already be familiar with this from :ref:`onlinebook_first_steering_file`.

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/071_fei.py
        :language: python
        :end-at: E60


ϒ(4S) Reconstruction
********************

Now, let's get started with the reconstruction. We will first create the signal B meson, then combine it with the B
meson provided by the FEI to get the ϒ(4S).

As the semileptonic decay we are analysing contains a neutrino,  a few things have to be considered.
The neutrino is not used the reconstruction of the B\ :sub:`sig` as it can't be seen in the Belle II detector.
This leads to a discrepancy between the simulated decay and the reconstructed decay,
causing the `isSignal` variable to always be zero.

To solve this you can tell the MC matching algorithm to accept missing neutrinos by using the ``?nu`` flag,
similar to the ``?addbrems`` flag introduced in :ref:`onlinebook_various_additions`.
Just add this flag to the end of the decay string in `modularAnalysis.reconstructDecay`. [#f1]_


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Reconstruct a B\ :sup:`0` meson particle list called ``B0:signal`` from a positive pion and a muon.
    Add the ``?nu`` flag as described above.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/071_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S113
        :end-at: E113


So far, we have not used the FEI. Now, we will use the B\ :sub:`tag` in the udst file and combine it with the
B\ :sub:`sig` we have just created.


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Combine the ``B0:generic`` from the udst file with the
    ``anti-B0:signal`` to a list called ``Upsilon(4S):opposite_cp`` .

    **NOTE**: The ``B0:generic`` should come first in the decay string, otherwise
    the missing mass squared variable we're using later won't know which of the B mesons
    is the tag and which is the signal.

    Can you think of a reason for the ``opposite_cp`` identifier of the ``Upsilon(4S)``
    list?

    Have we forgotten something?

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    Think of special properties of B\ :sup:`0` mesons compared to B\ :sup:`+` mesons.

    For the implementation: You will most likely need one more `modularAnalysis.reconstructDecay`
    to create the second particle list and the `modularAnalysis.copyLists` function to combine both lists.

.. admonition:: Solution
    :class: toggle solution

    To account for B\ :sup:`0` meson mixing, you should also combine same-sign B\ :sup:`0` mesons as the
    anti-B\ :sup:`0` can oscillate to a B\ :sup:`0`.

    .. literalinclude:: steering_files/071_fei.py
        :language: python
        :start-at: S70
        :end-at: E70


Now that we have reconstructed the full ϒ(4S), we will create a Rest of Event.
You have already done this in :ref:`onlinebook_roe` for a B meson, here however we
will create a Rest of Event for the ϒ(4S). This allows us to count the tracks left over after reconstructing the ϒ(4S),
for two correctly reconstructed B mesons there should be no tracks left over.

For this to work we have to use a slightly different ROE mask than in the ROE chapter. To match the cuts used by the
FEI to reconstruct B\ :sub:`tag` candidates, we have to tighten the cut on `dr` to below 2 and the cut on the absolute
value of `dz` (``abs(dz)``) to below 4. The two other cuts (on `pt` and `thetaInCDCAcceptance`) can be left as-is.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Create a Rest of Event for the ``Upsilon(4S)`` list. Then, append an ROE mask using the cuts introduced in the
    chapter :ref:`onlinebook_roe` and the additional track cuts mentioned above.

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    The track cuts should be ``thetaInCDCAcceptance and pt > 0.075 and dr < 2 and abs(dz) < 4`` and the ecl cuts
    ``thetaInCDCAcceptance and E > 0.05``.
    To create the ROE, use `modularAnalysis.buildRestOfEvent`.
    To append the ROE mask, use `modularAnalysis.appendROEMasks`.

Writing out the nTuple
**********************

We are now ready to add MC matching and write out the nTuple.

While the MC matching is applied to the ``Upsilon(4S)`` list, you can also access the daughter's truth variables using
the `daughter` metavariable.

This is especially useful in FEI analyses:

As you might have noticed in the first part of the exercise, the number of perfectly (i.e. ``isSignal == 1.0``)
reconstructed B\ :sub:`tag` mesons is not very large  As we are only really
interested in the B\ :sub:`sig`, the `isSignal` variable of this B meson can be a better signal
definition than the `isSignal` variable of the ``Upsilon(4S)``

In addition to the properties of the B mesons, we can now also use information from the full event.

An example here is the missing mass squared in the variable `m2RecoilSignalSide`.
This quantity should peak at zero for decays in which only one neutrino is missing and thus provides high
separating power in (semi-)leptonic analyses.
There are different implementations of the missing mass squared in *basf2*, this version uses the explicit
B\ :sub:`tag` momentum (here reconstructed by the FEI) and has therefore a high resolution.

A second variable with high separating power is the number of additional charged tracks introduced above.
This variable is called `nROE_Charged` in basf2. It needs the ROE mask name defined above as an argument in brackets.

.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Add MC matching for the ``Upsilon(4S)`` to your path.

    Write the Upsilon(4S) particle list to an nTuple. Include the variables used in the first part of the lesson,
    the signal variables mentioned above (both for the B\ :sub:`sig` and the ϒ(4S)), the missing mass squared and
    the number of additional tracks.

    It is recommended to define aliases for the variables as otherwise the variables will be long and unwieldy
    in your offline analysis.

    Finally, don't forget to process the path!

.. admonition:: Hint
    :class: toggle xhint stacked

    If you have forgotten how to use aliases: This is introduced in :ref:`onlinebook_various_additions`.

    If you have adapted the solution given here, the variable containing the number of additional tracks
    will be ``nROE_Charged(my_mask)``.

Offline analysis (part 2)
*************************

Like in the first part of this lesson, you can now analyse your nTuple. As before, you can use the FEI signal
probability (now under the alias ``Btag_SigProb`` if you have adapted the example) to select more pure
ϒ(4S) candidates and plot `m2RecoilSignalSide` for different values of the classifier.

You can also see how cuts on the number of additional tracks change the histogram.

**NOTE**: A histogram of `Mbc` will look quite different in this part of the exercise,
this is because in the last exercise we have used a generic MC sample and in this exercise we are using
an MC sample with only four decay channels.


.. admonition:: Exercise
    :class: exercise stacked

    Plot `m2RecoilSignalSide` for ``Bsig_isSignal == 1.0`` to see what well-reconstructed B -> pi l nu decays should
    look like.
    Then, plot `m2RecoilSignalSide` for different cuts on the FEI classifier output. See also how the shape of
    `m2RecoilSignalSide` changes when requiring zero additional tracks.

Congratulations, you now know how to run the FEI and how to use it in your analysis. If you would like to know more
you can always read the extensive documentation of the FEI. Here you can also find instructions on how to train the FEI
and explanations on the code structure.

.. admonition:: Key points
    :class: key-points

    * Get the weight files from the conditions database
    * Add the FEI to your path with `fei.get_default_channels` and `fei.FeiConfiguration`.
    * FEI Purity and efficiency are controlled by a cut on ``extraInfo(SignalProbability)``
    * The B\ :sub:`tag` from the FEI can be used to construct a complete ϒ(4S) event.

.. [#f1] Alternatively, you can also use the `isSignalAcceptMissingNeutrino` variable instead of `isSignal`
            but we will be going with the ``?nu`` flag and `isSignal` in our example.
