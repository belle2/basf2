    	* The previous lesson

    **Questions**:

        * What is a vertex fit?
        * When do I want to perform a vertex fit?
	* How should I choose my fit and constraints?

    **Objectives**:

        * Perform vertex fit of a decay

Vertex/Kinematic fitting is a technique where one uses prior knowledge on the nature of a decay to improve the measurement of its observables.
