---------------------------------------

If you are an *expert* of some topics, please **share your knowledge**!
This is not only an act of altrustism: Your contribution will

* save you from having to answer the same questions over and over again
* bring your students up to speed fast, so they can work *for* you and not the other way round
* make people use your code/modules/work more readily
* contribute to the success of this collaboration (you're a stakeholder)

If you are a *newcomer*, please **help to improve this material**! 
You know where this book is lacking. 
Precisely at the parts where you're feeling stuck or left alone! Tell us and we can fix it together!
This is not only an act of altruism:
* Let's face it, passively reading through tons of new stuff can be incredibly tiresome. 
  But you can change that! By trying to fix things here, you are much more actively working with the 
  topics and deepen your knowledge while gaining hands on experience with our collaborative tools and software!
* You also get your questions answered and people will thank you for raising them!
