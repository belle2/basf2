We want YOU to contribute to this book!
---------------------------------------

If you are an **expert** of some topics, *please share your knowledge*!
This is not only an act of altruism: Your contribution will

* save you from having to answer the same questions over and over again
* bring your students up to speed fast, so they can work *for* you and not
  the other way round
* make people use your code/modules/work more readily
* contribute to the success of this collaboration (you're a stakeholder)

If you are a **newcomer**, please *help to improve this material*!
You know where this book is lacking.
Precisely at the parts where you're feeling stuck or left alone! Tell us and
we can fix it together!
This is not only an act of altruism:

* Let's face it, passively reading through tons of new stuff can be
  incredibly tiresome.
  But you can change that! By trying to fix things here, you are much
  more actively working with the topics and deepen your knowledge
  while gaining hands on experience with our   collaborative tools and software!
* Having your first commit in the software framework should really be considered
  to be a rite of passage.
* You also get your questions answered and people will thank you for raising them!
* If you've already read our bylaws, then you know that in order to become an
  author of the Belle/Belle II papers, you need to complete quite a bit of
  *service work* (basically work that you cannot publish in a journal but that
  is required for the collaboration). Any work you do on training and documentation
  counts towards that goal as well!
