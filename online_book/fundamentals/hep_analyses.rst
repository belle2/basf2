    **Teaching**: 

    **Exercises**: 

    **Prerequisites**: 
    	
    	* None

    **Questions**:

        * What is the usual HEP workflow?
        * How to reconstruct particles?
        * What is truth-matching?
        * What is continuum data?
        * What is a tagged analysis?
        * How does the Belle II detector work?

    **Objectives**:

        * Learn everything you need in order to undertsand
          what the software is supposed to do.


.. admonition:: Key points
    :class: key-points

    * In HEP we compare reconstructed data events with reconstructions of 
      detector simulations of MC generated events
    * Every measurement and algorithm is flawed; use truth-matching to
      get a feeling for how well the software works
