How to contribute
=================

* Something is **wrong**/**misleading**: Fix it with a pull request or raise the issue by creating a JIRA ticket.
  If you are unsure about it, you can ask on `questions.belle2.org <questions.belle2.org>`_ before.
* Something is **missing**: If you're not sure whether it belongs here, ask the librarians, e.g. by creating a JIRA ticket
  or per email. You can either assign the JIRA ticket to someone you like or submit a pull request for it yourself (preferred).
