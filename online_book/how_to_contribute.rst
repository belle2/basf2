Why contribute? Read our propaganda at :doc:`/online_book/contribute`.

How to contribute
=================

* Something is **wrong**/**misleading**: Fix it with a pull request or raise the issue by creating a JIRA ticket.
  If you are unsure about it, you can ask on `questions.belle2.org <https://questions.belle2.org>`_ before.
* You notice that something is **missing**: 
  
  * If you're not sure whether it belongs here, ask the librarians, e.g. by creating a JIRA ticket
    or per email. You can either assign the JIRA ticket to someone you like or submit a pull request for it yourself (preferred).
  * If it is already marked as a todo item, check if someone else is working on it (search on JIRA) and if not,
    submit a pull request

Technical side

Understanding Sphinx and RST
----------------------------

This webpage is built with Sphinx_ using source files in reStructuredText_ (``*.rst``) format. 

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/
.. _reStructuredText: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html

See :doc:`/framework/doc/atend-doctools` to learn more about these tools.

.. hint::
   If you want to learn sphinx by looking at the sources of various pages, 
   click on the ``View page source`` button on the
   top right of the web page. 

.. hint::
   The source file of each file is apparent from the URL. E.g. this page
   has the URL ``.../online_book/how_to_contribute.html``, so your source
   file is in ``${BELLE2_LOCAL_DIR}/online_book/how_to_contribute.rst``.
