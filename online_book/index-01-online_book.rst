.. tip::

   Just as there are many versions of the Belle 2 software, there are many
   versions of this documentation to match it. After all, if a new feature is
   added in our software, we also want to have the documentation for it.

   The current version of this documentation is shown on the top left of this
   page, just below the logo. You can also change your version by clicking on
   `other versions <https://software.belle2.org/>`_.

   For the StarterKit in October 2020, we use the "newest" version, called **development**.

.. warning::

   If you change the version to an earlier version, some pages (also this page!)
   might not exist. You will learn more about our software and its versions
   (releases) `later on <onlinebook_basf2_introduction>`_.

.. warning::

   If you read the documentation of a newer version than the software that
   you use (in particular the development version), you might not yet be able
   to use some of the features shown.

.. tip::

   If you get stuck or have any questions during a StarterKit workshop, the
   `#starterkit-workshop channel <https://chat.belle2.org/channel/starterkit-workshop>`_
   in our chat is full of nice people who will provide instant help.

   The first lesson of this book (:ref:`onlinebook_collaborative_tools`) will show
   several other places where you can get help later on.
