.. tip::

   Just as there are many versions of the Belle 2 software, there are many
   versions of this documentation to match it. After all, if a new feature is
   added in our software, we also want to have the documentation for it.

   The current version of this documentation is shown on the top left of this
   page, just below the logo. You can also change your version by clicking on
   `other versions <https://software.belle2.org/>`_.

   If you are a new to all of this, we recommend you to select the
   *recommended release version* (``release-xx-xx-xx (recommended)`` in the
   above list).

   You can also take a sneak peek at the most recent version of the documentation by selecting
   the `development version <https://software.belle2.org/development/sphinx/online_book/index-01-online_book.html>`_.
   However not all of the code examples might work for you yet.

   The earliest release version which contains this online book is
   ``release-05-01-12``.

.. warning::

   If you change the version to an earlier version than the current one, some pages (also this page!)
   might not exist.

.. warning::

   If you read the documentation of a newer version than the software that
   you use (in particular the development version), you might not yet be able
   to use some of the features shown.

.. tip::

   If you get stuck or have any questions to the online book material, the
   `#starterkit-workshop channel <https://chat.belle2.org/channel/starterkit-workshop>`_
   in our chat is full of nice people who will provide fast help.
   However this is not the place for specific or very detailed questions about
   your own analysis.

   The first lesson of this book (:ref:`onlinebook_collaborative_tools`) will show
   several other places where you can get help later on.
   It also includes a quick tips section about the chat:
   :ref:`onlinebook_collaborative_tools_b2chat_howto`.
