Hi there, thanks for completing the online book! We wish you all the best for
your journey in Belle II!

Before you go though, please consider staying in touch with us and contributing
to the training and documentation resources. :ref:`onlinebook_contribute`
explains why this is a win-win situation for everyone (and why "but I just started!"
is not an acceptable excuse ;))

If you're interested in getting to know us better,

* join our `chat.belle2 channel <https://chat.belle2.org/channel/training-documentation>`_
* `subscribe to our mailing list <https://lists.belle2.org/sympa/info/software-doc>`_ ``software-doc@belle2.org``
* visit our `confluence page <https://confluence.desy.de/x/IzpnAw>`_ which also
  shows our next meetings and has a display of open issues on JIRA

Some possible ideas for contributions:

* Fixing wrong/misleading/insufficient documentation
* Creating new training lessons in the online book
* Recording video walk throughts for the lessons
* Hunting for outdated information on confluence and removing it/bringing it to sphinx

and probably much more issues that you have already noticed yourself.

Below are a couple of more pages that might get you started:
