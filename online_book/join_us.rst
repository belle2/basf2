Hi there, thanks for completing the online book! The *Software Training & Documentation Group*
wishes you all the best for your journey in Belle II!

Before you go though, please consider staying in touch with us and contributing
to the training and documentation resources. :ref:`onlinebook_contribute`
explains why this is a win-win situation for everyone (and why "but I'm new here!"
is not an acceptable excuse :P).

If you're interested in getting to know us better,

* join our `chat.belle2 channel <https://chat.belle2.org/channel/training-documentation>`_
* `subscribe to our mailing list <https://lists.belle2.org/sympa/info/software-doc>`_ ``software-doc@belle2.org``
* visit our `confluence page <https://confluence.desy.de/x/IzpnAw>`_ which also
  shows our next meetings and has a display of open issues on GitLab

Some possible ideas for contributions:

* Fixing wrong/misleading/insufficient documentation
* Creating new training lessons in the online book
* Recording video walk throughts for the lessons
* Hunting for outdated information on confluence and removing it/bringing it to sphinx

and probably much more issues that you have already noticed yourself.

Below are a couple of more pages that might get you started:
