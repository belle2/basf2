   If you get stuck or have any questions to the online book material, the
   `#starterkit-workshop channel <https://chat.belle2.org/channel/starterkit-workshop>`_
   in our chat is full of nice people who will provide fast help.

   Refer to :ref:`onlinebook_collaborative_tools` for other

.. admonition:: Improving things!
    :class: hint toggle stacked

    If you know how to do it, we recommend you to report bugs and other requests
    with `GitLab <https://gitlab.desy.de/belle2/software/basf2/-/issues>`_.
    Make sure to use the ``documentation-training`` label of the ``basf2`` project.

    If you just want to give very quick feedback, use the last box
    "Quick feedback".

    Please make sure to be as precise as possible to make it easier for us
    to fix things! So for example:

    * typos (where?)
    * missing bits of information (what?)
    * bugs (what did you do? what goes wrong?)
    * too hard exercises (which one?)
    * etc.

    If you are familiar with git and want to create your first merge request
    for the software, take a look at :ref:`onlinebook_how_to_contribute`.
    We'd be happy to have you on the team!
