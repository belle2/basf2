    Thanks a lot for completing this lesson! A lot of time was spent creating
    and improving it. So here's one thing that we ask of you in return: Please
    take `this quick survey <https://forms.gle/saJ4DAe5xn5FzY5H6>`_ to help us
    improve this even more. It's anonymous, no account required and should only
    take 3-5 minutes.

.. admonition:: Further notes
    :class: toggle xhint

    The more precise your comments are, the easier it is for us to improve.
    Things you can report:

    * typos (where?)
    * missing bits of information (what?)
    * bugs (what goes wrong?)
    * too hard exercises (which one?)
    * etc.

    If you know how to do it, we recommend you to report bugs and other requests
    with `JIRA <https://agira.desy.de/>`_. Make sure to use the
    ``documentation-training`` component of the ``Belle II Software`` project.

    Note however that this is not the place to get immediate help if you're
    being stuck (see :numref:`onlinebook_collaborative_tools` instead).
