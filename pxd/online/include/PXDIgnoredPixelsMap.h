   * pixels for the use in PXD data reconstruction.
   * The class has non-intrusive behavior, that is, it will not interfere when
   * queries on non-existent sensors are asked.
   * Treatment of single masked pixels and masked ranges (rows, cols, ...) is
   * different for performance reasons.
   *
   * NOTE: More optimization is possible:
   *  - single rows and cols can go to hash tables (like pixels), as they can be uniquely identified.
   *    Then we would have m_MaskRows, m_MaskCols etc.
   *  - lambdas for ranges of cols/rows can be simplified (2 less comparisons)
   * or even
   *  - instead hash tables, one could use directly vectors/arrays/std\::bitset and only pixels, but
   *    with much more memory for map of all sensors (at least 8Mbit for whole Belle2 PXD & std::bitset)
