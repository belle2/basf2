# Container for names of generator models that are available for selection.
#
# Each model name is assumed to match a corresponding Python module that
# is located in the package `pxd.background_generator.models` and
# implements the specific model, i.e. defines a:
#     * class `Model`,
#     * function `generate`.
#
# The class `Model` must inherit from the base class `torch.nn.Module`.
#
# The generation function `generate` specific to a model is assumed
# to act on a model instance and produce an output of type `torch.Tensor`
# that is of shape `(40, 250, 768)` and contains values of type `torch.uint8`
# in the interval \f$ [0, 255] \f$. Each index in the first axis of the
# output tensor is assumed to correspond to the PXD sensor specified
# by the `VxdID` arguments in `pxd.background_generator.VXDID_ARGS`
# at the same index.
