Reconstruction
==============

This package contains code for some posttracking reconstruction tasks, as well
as scripts to run the official reconstruction for Belle II. Dedicated modules
are included for determinations of ionization energy loss (dE/dx) in the CDC and
VXD as well as for KLID. Data objects for combined reconstruction information
such as PID and event T0, as well as the general mDST structure, are defined
here as well. While the reconstruction script defines the methods used for
default reconstruction, most of the modules that run reconstruction tasks are
defined in dedicated packages.
