"""
This script determines the time spent in each part of the simulation. It does
that by assigning regions to the geometry created by each creator and then
measuring the time spent in these regions using the G4VSteppingVerbose
facilities provided by Geant4. These get compiled out in the opt version of the
externals so this only works with the debug externals. It was intended as a
validation script but due to this problem it was moved to examples

Generate detailed timing information of the simulation when simulating
100 EvtGen events.
WARNING: Does not work in parallel processing mode
