Skims
=====

Skim package doesn't have sphinx documentation yet, by you can take a look at `confluence page <https://confluence.desy.de/display/BI/Skimming+Homepage>`_.
To get information about existing skim, ask current skim group convener.
If you would like to work on documentation,, feel free to take `agira ticket <https://agira.desy.de/browse/BII-3603>`_. In this case you might need nice guid on Sphinx documentation: :ref:`doctools` .
