Skims

The skim package is a collection of high-level analysis scripts that reduce the data set to a manageable size by applying a simple selection.
The input to a skim are MDST files of processed data. The output is a so-called uDST (micro-DST) which actually contains more information but fewer events.
That is, a uDST file contains the same as an MDST but with the addition of `ParticleList`_ objects of candidates build using the `modularAnalysis` tools.
