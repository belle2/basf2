Skims

The skim package is a collection of high-level analysis scripts that reduce the data set to a manageable size by applying a simple selection.
The input to a skim are :ref:`mdst` files of processed data.
The output are so-called :ref:`analysis_udstoutput` (udst) files.
These files actually contain more information but fewer events.

.. tip:: Analysts are recommended to use skimmed udst files as input to their analysis.

To get information about existing skim, ask the current skim group liaison.

.. tip:: For an introductory lesson, take a look at :numref:`onlinebook_skim`.
