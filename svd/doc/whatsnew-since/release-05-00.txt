Changes in the svd package since release-05-00
---------------------------------------------------

Reconstruction
++++++++++++++

 * the cluster position reconstruction is computed with the CoG algorithm for all cluster sizes > 1 (AHT was previously used for cluster size > 2)

*

Simulation
++++++++++

 * a different charge sharing model is implemented: now couplings are extracted directly from data
