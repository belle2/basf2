Changes in the svd package since release-06-00
---------------------------------------------------

Beam-Background
+++++++++++++++

* above-threshold strips due to cross-talk are added in the background overlay for simulated background

Reconstruction
++++++++++++++

* fudge factors are introduced in the reconstruction of the SVD cluster position and time
  of simulated events in order to match the resolution measured on data.

* correction of the APV charge sharing is applied in the determination of the cluster position when reconstructing data
