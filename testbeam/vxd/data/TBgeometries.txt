... file with individuall components the geometry is created of.

27. Jan 2014 21:00 The number of SVD strips in U/V is changed back to the convention of Belle2. But it goes to "our conventional" TB directions.
                   Nothing should be affected by this change.

19. Jan 2014 2:40 Corrected some materials a bit: PolyEthylen

12. Jan 2014 16:00 Updated VXDBox with hole for better visibility of detectors from side and moved a bit to more precise position

11. Jan 2014 18:00 Bug corrected: flipped number of strips in U/V in SVD layer 4,5,6. Smaller SVD module layer3

11. Jan 2014 12:00 first tracked version

... Complete geometry with deactivated telescopes. All sensors centered (except SVD3 moved by 4.8mm down)

8. Jan 2014 23:55 first version



FullTelescopeVXDTB.xml 
----------------------
... Complete geometry with active telescopes. All sensors centered (except SVD3 moved by 4.8mm down)

8. Jan 2014 23:55 first version



FullTelescopeVXDTB_v1.xml
-------------------------
... from PXD only active areas are present, but made from air (they are active volumes) ... for ROI testing purposes
This file should be used for testbeam analysis from Jan 6 to PXD installation (expected Jan 13)
WARNING: The position of the telescopes is approximate (with tolerance up to 1cm)

12. Jan 2014 16:00 Telescopes moved to more realistic positions

11. Jan 2014 18:00 Flipped SVD orientation to comply with strip counting

10. Jan 2014 18:00 Removed pxd frame, cooling block, etc. as it is not present in the real geometry

9. Jan 2014 18:40 backward telescopes were 3cm under axis, pxd 12mm in last commit. In this version, everything is centered again

9. Jan 2014 11:00 fixed bug in phantom pxds

8. Jan 2014 23:55 first version



FullTelescopeVXDTB_v2.xml
-------------------------
... this is the setup with PXD6-S (4 switchers) facing SVD layer 3. PCBoard and sensor from layer 2 (facing front telescopes) is removed.

28. Jan 2014 12:00 Re-centering PXD layer to after the rotation from previous commit

27. Jan 2014 21:00 Additional rotation by 180deg introduced to PXD layer 2 to have right correlations with SVD.
                   WARNING: whole sensor is rotated instead just a sensitive area. This will be fixed after test of HLT ROIs.
                            It now only affects a bit dead material distribution.

19. Jan 2014 2:40 Improved position of telescopes by info from LOG book. Corrected some materials a bit.

14. Jan 2014 9:30 Correted vxdId + first pxd from air (only sensitive), second is real

... magnetic field for PCMag ... currently constant B(z)=-0.975 T

28. Jan 2014 12:00 The sign of the field was flipped (from B(z)=0.975T to B(z)=-0.975T ... so electrons go up.
