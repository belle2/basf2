  /**
   * Module for the comparison of different sets of time base correction (TBC) constants and to produce monitoring plots out of a given set.
   *
   * 1) Input format
   * The input constants are given in the histogram format provided by the TOPTimeCalibrator module. According to the current (2017)
   * TBC production standards, all the root files belonging to the same calibration set must be locaded in one single directory, with no more than one level of subdirectories.
   * An example of a valid directory stucture for the input is:
   *
   * CalibrationSetRootFolder/tbc_ch0/
   *                          tbc_ch1/
   *                          tbc_ch2/
   *                          ...
   *                          tbc_ch7/
   *
   * where the root files are located under tbc_chX/
   * The module is sensitive to the name format of the input files, since slot, BS and scrod ID are parsed from them.
   * The naming is tbcSlotXX_Y-scrodZZZ.root, where XX is the slot number, Y is the BS number, and ZZZ is the scrodID. Both 2- and 3-digits scrodID are allowed.
   *
   * To specify the calibration sets to be analyzed and compared, the user must provide a text file containing the absolute path to the CalibrationSetRootFolder, and a label to identify the calibration set.
   * Separate sets are specified on separate lines of this configuration file:
   *
   * /absolute/path/to/CalibrationSetRootFolder1/  LabelSet1
   * /absolute/path/to/CalibrationSetRootFolder2/  LabelSet2
   * /absolute/path/to/CalibrationSetRootFolder3/  LabelSet3
   *
   *
   * 2) Basic functions
   * - The output histograms are declared as private members, and are initialized in the defineHisto() function
   * - The main loop that runs over all the datasets and all the rootfiles is implemented in endRun(), that calls the two main functions of this module,
   *   analyzeCalFile() and  makeComparisons().
   * - First all the calset-by-calset histograms are filled, then the comparisons are done by taking ratios of these histograms
   * - The output writing is done in the terminate() function
   * - The histogram filling is performed in the analyzeFile() function, called in the main loop over the calibration sets inside endRun().
   * - The histogram comparison is performed in the makeComparisons() function, called in endRun() outside the main loop over the calibration sets.
   *
   *
   * 3) How to add a new histogram
   * - Declare it as private member.
   * - Initialize it in defineHisto()
   * - Fill it in analyzeCalFile() (if it is a simple monitoring plot) or in  makeComparisons() (if it compares plots from different datasets)
   * - Write it in the output file in terminate()
   *
   *
   * 4) How to add a new comparison histogram
   * - Create an histogram array (hQuantity) that saves the quantity you want calset-by-calset, and fill it in analyzeCalFile()
   * - Create an histogram to save the comparson (hQuantityCom), and fill it in the makeComparisons() usig the hQuantity histograms. You can use the calculateHistoRatio() utility to do that.
