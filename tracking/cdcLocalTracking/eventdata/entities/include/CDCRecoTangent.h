    /** A reconstructed tangent is an approximation of the possible trajectory between two wire hits. \n
     *  The approximation is obtained by constructing a tangent between two drift circles of the wire hits  \n
     *  ( in the reference xy projection ) \n
     *  Generally maximal four tangents are possible. So to uniquely define a tangent we have \n
     *  to give additional information how it passes relativ to the drift circles. This right left \n
     *  passage inforamtion indicates if the related wire hit should lie to the right of to the left \n
     *  of the tangent. The four possible combinations are then ( RIGHT , RIGHT ), ( RIGHT , LEFT ), \n
     *  ( LEFT , RIGHT ), ( LEFT , LEFT ). \n
     *  To represent the tangent this class uses a ParameterLine2D. The touch points to the two drift circles \n
     *  are located at(0) for the first and at(1) for the second. \n
     *  The tangent has therefor a sense of what is forward and can be reversed if necessary \n
     *  Generally tangents are only a good approximation between neighboring wire hits.*/
