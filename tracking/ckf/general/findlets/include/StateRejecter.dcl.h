   * Reject some (or all) states from a given list of child states using 5 filters.
   * Typically the filters are applied in the order:
   *
   *    filter, extrapolation, filter, kalman update, filter
   *
   * Tor simplicity, the extrapolation and the kalman update are also implemented using filters,
   * so it is possible to use a filter factory here.
   *
   * All filters get as input the current path and the full list of child states, so it
   * is possible to look for the best N states etc. The filters themselves are responsible
   * for deleting the not-wanted states.
