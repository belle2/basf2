SVD Track Finding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^



The VXDTF2 is the standalone pattern recognition algorithm for both of the silicon detectors. It is capable of 
doing full 6 layer tracking (SVD+PXD). Though in the current tracking chain PXD hits are treated separately thus the 
VXDTF2 is used for SVD track finding only. In this page there is a brief description of the logic behind this pattern recognition algorithm.


Reduction of the combinatorial burden with the SectorMaps
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The goal is to extract track patterns from a huge number of possible combinations of space points (3D hits) in the 4 SVD layers.
The logic behind the reduction of the number of combinations is the following:
divide the sensors into sectors (NxM). Only combine SpacePoints belonging to friend-sectors, where two sectors are defined as friend if they are directly connected by a track. 
Background SpacePoints are rejected using dedicated filters which use simple geometric relations between sectors and hit time information.

The connections defining friend sectors are learned from simulation. In order to avoid attaching background hits to patterns, filters based on 2- or 3-hit combinations are also learned from simulation.
The SectorMap stores the information about the friendship relations between sectors and a set of selection requirements (filters = {variable, range}) used to reject background hits. The filters 
are defined (and stored in the SectorMap) individually for each occurring combination of friend sector relations, meaning that different combination of friend sectors usually have 
different ranges for the filters defined.

      Two-hit filter example

Variables used in the filters are geometric (distances, slopes) or properties of the SVD clusters, like the cluster time. There are two types of filters defined within 
the framework. There are 2-hit filters, defined for the selection of 2-hit combination, and 3-hit filters, defined for the selection of 3-hit combinations, defined. 
Variables used in the current implementation of filters are listed in the following tables. For 2-hit filters are following variables used:

For 3-hit filters a larger variaty and more complex quanities can be calculated due to the information the third hit is adding. The 3-hit filters currently used in the SectorMap are the following:

Note the names for the variables in the tables are the same as the class names used in the implementation. 


The allowed range for each filter is learned from simulation, filling the distribution of the variable during the training and defining threshold as max and min of the distribution (or 0.1% and 99.9% quantile?).
Using the friendship relations and the filters, segments connecting two, three or four SpacePoints are built. At this stage a single SpacePoint can be shared by more than one segment and we are ready to build track candidates that are identified and collected by a Cellular Automaton.

SectorMap Training
""""""""""""""""""

The training of the SectorMap is a critical step for the performance of the pattern recognition. Important aspects of the training are:

* division of the sensor in sectors: we use a 4x4 division
* sample used for the training (size, types of simulated events): we use :math:`10\times10^6\ B\bar{B}` + :math:`2\times 10^6` Bhabha events, both samples have additional muon tracks mixed in using the `particlegun`
* pruning: removal of friendship relations that are less used: the threshold is set at 70%
* difference in misalignment between simulation and real detector: we train on perfectly aligned MC, for data we now use a `geometry` using alignment data.

Further details on the SectorMap training and a detailed description of steps to be taken to train a SectorMap can be found under:

Track Candidates identified by the Cellular Automaton
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The SectorMaps is used to produce the Segment Network, a set of segments (a pair of SpacePoints) that satisfy the friendship relations and the filters.
A Cellular Automaton which uses segments as cells is run to gather the longest paths.

Best Candidate Selection
""""""""""""""""""""""""

We do not allow that track candidates found by the VXDTF2 share common hits. To achieve that a best candidate selection is performed. At the moment two algorithms are implemented to perform the best candidate selection which can be chosen by a Module parameter. 

One is the so called `Hopfield` which builds a Hopfield network out of all track candidates and performs an optimization on that network. The resulting set of output track candidates do not share any hits among each other. 

The second algorithm is a so called `greedy` algorithm. It selects from the initial set of track candidates the one with the highest quality based on the output of a quality estimator. This track candidate is removed from the initial set of track candidates and put into the final set of track candidates. In addition all track candidates which share at least one hit with this track candidate are removed from the initial set of track candidates. This procedure is repeated until the initial set of track candidates is empty. The output is the final set of track candidates. Currently a simple Triplet fit is used as quality estimator:


* a Triplet Fit is applied to each path and sub paths obtained by excluding one or more space points
* for each track candidate the sum of the chi2 of each triplet is computed
* the p-value of each track candidate is used to select the track candidates competing for one or more space points


During operation it was observed that the `Hopfield` algorithm is significantly slower compared to the `greedy` algorithm. For that reason the `greedy` algorithm is applied which is much faster than the `Hopfield` while shows similar performance in terms of efficiency and fake rate.
