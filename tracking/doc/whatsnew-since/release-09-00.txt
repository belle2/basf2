Changes in the tracking package since release-09-00
----------------------------------------------------

Track Fit
++++++++++

* it's now possible to use different configurations of the Deterministic Annealing Filter (DAF) for track fits of: (1) cosmics, (2) track fit after the CDC pattern recognition (i.e. the fit in the toSVD CKF), (3) all other fits

* the TrackFitMomentumRange, that determines the momentum ranges in which a track fit for a mass hypothesis should be run, now uses the fitted momentum when available, instead of the RecoTrack seed momentum

Convenience Functions
+++++++++++++++++++++

* it is now possible to append the Cellular Automaton pattern recognition to the path via python parameter
