  /**
   * Helper class to perform all kind of track extrapolations using the methods from arXiv:0810.2241.
   *
   * The event time is calculated as one would calculate an alignment
   * parameter.  We follow the prescription in arXiv:0810.2241
   * [physics.ins-det] to build the full covariance matrix for the
   * Kalman-fitted track (DAF counts as Kalman).  We then evaluate the
   * change in event time that minimizes the sum of chi^2s of the tracks
   * following the same procedure that is decribed in loc.cit.
   *
   * Unlike the case of alignment, we only have one free parameter (time),
   * and therefore there are no large matrices to invert.  The necessary
   * timeshift is calculated from the estimated derivatives of chi2^2 in
   * the linear approximation as
   *                dchi^2   /d^2chi^2
   *   delta t = - -------- / -------- .
   *                  dt   /    dt^2
   * Here division replaces a matrix inverse (this is loc.cit. Eq. (8)).
   *
   * Time-dependence of the fit result comes from the CDC hits, where a
   * later time of particle passage corresponds to a greater drift
   * circle.
