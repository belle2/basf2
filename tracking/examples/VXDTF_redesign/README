To train a sector map for VXDTF2 one has to execute the following python scripts with basf2, in that order:
eventSimulation.py
trainingPreparation.py
trainSecMap.py

For a more detailed description on how to use them please refer to the comments within those files.


The default geometry assumed is the one of Belle2. If one sets the environmental variable
USE_BEAST2_GEOMETRY
(e.g. by 'export USE_BEAST2_GEOMETRY=something' or 'setenv USE_BEAST2_GEOMETRY something'), BEFORE running
the scripts, for each of the above mentioned python scripts the 
Beast Phase 2 geometry is assumed.
