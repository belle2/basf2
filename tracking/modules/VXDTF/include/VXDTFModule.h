     * This leads to a constant surpression of all overlapping TCs.
     * The result is that all the neuron values stay below the threshold until the neuronal network stops and all overlapping TCs get deactivated.
     * Since this is a problem the hopfield network was not developed for, we have to filter these cases. Another issue is the situation, where the majority of hits are shared, but there are some foreign hits included too.
