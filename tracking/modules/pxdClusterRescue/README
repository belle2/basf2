These folders contain following modules:

// PXDClusterGetNNData
Extracts training variables for tools/NeuroBayesTrainer, which are needed to train the network for the PXDClusterRescueNN module.

// PXDClusterRescueNN
Runs the neural network rescue mechanism, which classifies clusters based on charge, size and coordinates.

// PXDClusterRescueNNAnalysis
Analysis module for PXDClusterRescueNN module. Mainly for debugging purposes.

// PXDClusterRescueROI
Runs the region of interest cluster rescue mechanism. This algorithm extrapolates from the outer detectors (SVD, CDC) to the PXD and defines with the Kalman filter uncertainties region of interest on the PXD sensors, which are likely to hold signal clusters.

// PXDClusterRescueROIAnalysis
Analysis module for PXDClusterRescueROI module. Mainly for debugging purposes.

// PXDClusterRescueAnalysis
Analysis tool for combined evaluation of neural network rescue mechanism and region of interest rescue mechanism. Main analysis tool to measure the performance of the cluster rescue mechanism.
