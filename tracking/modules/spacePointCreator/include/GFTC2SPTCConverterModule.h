  /**
   * Module for converting genfit::TrackCands to SpacePointTrackCands
   *
   * NOTE: requires:
   * + a StoreArray with PXD only SpacePoints
   * + a StoreArray with SVD SpacePoints, where only SpacePoints with a U & a V Cluster are present
   * + a StoreArray with SVD SpacePoints, where every Cluster has its own SpacePoint (if 'useSingleClusterSP' is set to true)
   *
   * Intended Behaviour: The Module takes a genfit::TrackCand and converts it to a SpacePointTrackCand by taking the TrackCandHits of the TrackCand and searching the DataStore for the according Clusters and then look for Relations of these Clusters to SpacePoints (without loosing any information of the genfit::TrackCand, such that every hit in the genfit::TrackCand can be found in a SpacePoint in the SpacePointTrackCand). Employing a somewhat sloppy notation below regarding Clusters and TrackCandHits, since they are essentially the same for this Module.
   *
   * NOTE: There are cases where the conversion cannot be done properly, in this case the genfit::TrackCand is skipped and will not be converted (by default, there are parameters that can change this behavior to only skip problematic Clusters)!
   * Problems only occur, when a Cluster is not unambiguously related to a SpacePoint (i.e. a Cluster is related to more than one SpacePoint), because:
   * + the decision which SpacePoint to use is not trivial in most cases. If no well defined decision can be made, the TrackCand will be skipped (see below how this decision is made, and when it is considered 'well defined')
   * + If no decision can be made and every SpacePoint would be added, problems would only be postponed to the conversion of SpacePointTrackCand to genfit::TrackCand, where it is even harder to decide what is right and what is wrong.
   * + To have a handle later on SpacePointTrackCands now have some flags to check what problems occured during conversion
   *
   * Some statements on how the module works for a given (SVD) Cluster (TrackCandHit)
   * 1) Check if the Cluster (TrackCandHit) has already been used (i.e. it is already contained in the SpacePointTrackCand via a SpacePoint). If not used
   * 2) Get all SpacePoints (double Cluster) related to this Cluster
   * 2.a) If no SpacePoints (double Cluster) can be found, add this Cluster via a single Cluster SpacePoint (should always be present, if not an exception is thrown, and the genfit::TrackCand is not converted). Mark this Cluster (TrackCandHit) as used and go to next Cluster (TrackCandHit)
   * 3) For every SpacePoint (double Cluster) related to the original Cluster, get all Clusters related from this SpacePoint
   * 4) For every SpacePoint (from 3) check if its Cluster combination is valid (i.e. both Clusters are contained in the genfit::TrackCand and neither of these Clusters has been used by another SpacePoint) and also check if its Cluster combination is not valid, but existing (i.e. both Clusters are contained in the genfit::TrackCand but one has already been used by another SpacePoint)
   * 5) If ONLY ONE SpacePoint has a valid Cluster Combination, check if its Clusters appear in consecutive order in the genfit::TrackCand, if they do -> take this SpacePoint, mark the Clusters (TrackCandHits) as used, proceed with next TrackCandHit. If they do not appear in consecutive order -> throw an exception (this SpacePointTrackCand cannot be converted back to a genfit::TrackCand properly)
   * 6) If more than SpacePoint has a valid Cluster Combination -> check if there is a SpacePoint with consecutive Clusters in the genfit::TrackCand ('normally' there is a Cluster Combination, that is in consecutive order in the genfit::TrackCand) and mark its Clusters as used, proceed with next TrackCandHit, if all valid SpacePoints have Cluster Combinations that do not appear in consecutive order -> throw
   * 7) If no valid SpacePoint can be found, but SpacePoints with existing (but used) Cluster Combinations can be found, an exception is thrown and the genfit::TrackCand will not be converted, since the conversion would get ambiguous then (this happens in roughly 1 - 2 % of all cases)
   * 8) If no valid SpacePoint can be found and no SpacePoint with existing (but used) Cluster Combinations, this Cluster will be added via a single Cluster SpacePoint (and then be marked as used) if this feature is activated by parameter 'useSingleClusterSP'
   *
   * If no SpacePoint can be found for any Cluster in the genfit::TrackCand, an exception is thrown, and the conversion is skipped.
   *
   * If 'checkTrueHits' is enabled the module only checks the DataStore if there is an existing relation to a TrueHit. Depending on the parameters the conversion of the genfit::TrackCand is aborted or only the Cluster is skipped from Conversion. (The registering of the relation has to be done with the SpacePoint2TrueHitConnector)
   *
   * TODO: clean-up and bring in line with coding conventions!
