   * Module that does some sanity checks on SpacePointTrackCands that have been created by conversion

   *
   * If set by the parameters the module does:
   * + check if a SPTC is curling (at the moment done by the CurlingTrackCandSplitter) and split into sub tracks if necessary
   * + check if two subsequent SpacePoints of a SPTC are on the same sensor
   * + check if two subsequent SpacePoints of a SPTC are seperated at least by a user defined distance (needed for some filters)
   * + all this checks either by using MC information (where necessary) or with information that can be obtained from the SpacePoint
   *
   * WARNING: Besides of setting different flags, splitting curling SPTCs and removing problematic SpacePoints (if set)
   * the module does nothing! Every decision on how to handle the different outcomes of the different checks is left to the user!
