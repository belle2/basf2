  /** Tries to add CDC stereo hits to the found CDC tracks by applying a histogramming method with a quad tree.
   *
   * A two-dimensional quad tree is used with $z_0$ in the one axis and the s-z-slope (tan lambda) on the other.
   * The module goes through each found axial track and for each track reconstructs either all stereo hits from the CDCWireHitTopology
   * or all found segments to match the r-phi trajectory of this track. The z-information is then used to determine the bin in the quad tree.
   * The hits resemble a straight line in the quad tree in z_0-tan lambda.
   *
   * The module can use the old and the new quad tree implementation - however the new one is prefered because it contains
   * a optimization step the old one does not have in the moment (but can be implemented easily).
   *
   * Everything action in hidden in the configurable collector algorithm, which can be used to perform various
   * collection algorithms, e.g. using the first found or best hit, using various filters/TMVA/etc.
   * The options can be configured using the module parameters.
   *
   * TODO:
   *   - Smarter Handling of segments (which is worse in the moment but should be better in general)
   *   - Make the precuts on the hits more transparent
