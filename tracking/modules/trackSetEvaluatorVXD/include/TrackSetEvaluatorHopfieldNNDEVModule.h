  /** The Hopfield algoritm Trackset Evaluator.
   *
   *  This module expects a container of SpacePointTrackCandidates (TCs) and selects a subset of non-overlapping
   *  TCs determined using a neural network of Hopfield type.
   *
   *  DESIGN DECISIONS:
   *  - The previous version has foreseen to first remove tracks without overlaps or subsamples,
   *    that don't overlap with different subsamples. However, the functionality isn't fully implemented and
   *    isn't used. To reduce the amount of dead code, we eliminated that option, but we can bring it back,
   *    if we think it is useful.
   *  - As well for the case of just two overlapping tracks, a fall back to the evaluation of all
   *    (2) combinations was foreseen. This is deleted as well.
   *  We recommend to first try with the generic case and use all possible optimizations there,
   *  before complicating the code structure again with the handling of special cases just for small
   *  speed improvements.
