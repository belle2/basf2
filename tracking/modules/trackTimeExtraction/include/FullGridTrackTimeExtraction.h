  /**
   * Module to extract the global event time using the CDC drift circles information.
   *
   * The core functionality is written and documented in the TimeExtractionUtils class.
   * This module just calls the extractTime function in the utilities multiply times and decides, when the
   * time extraction is good enough to finish.
   *
   * As a result of this module, the EventT0 StoreObjPtr is set to the extracted time.
   *
   * All the extraction is done using the RecoTracks stored in the given StoreArray.
   *
   * The module works in the following way:
   * * Use 4 defined event time seeds between T0 min and T0 max. Set the event time to this seed and extract the event
   *   time using the derivatives of chi^2 calculated in the TimeExtractionUtils after arXiv:0810.2241.
   *   This shift in event time is then applied to the reco tracks and the time is extracted again.
   *   One extracted time is called "converged" or "finished", if the second derivitive of chi^2 to the event time is
   *   large (which means that the measurement uncertainty on the event time is small) and the chi^2 is small too.
   *   If the fit which is needed in each step fails, do not use this extracted time.
   *   If the extracted time is not between min T0 and max T0, do also not use this extracted time.
   *
   * * If one or more of the extraction steps from above lead to a converged result, use the one with the lowest chi^2.
   *   If not, start a loop where each extraction point from above is used, the extraction is done twice again and
   *   checked, if it has converged now.
   *
   * * If no converged point is found at all, set the EventT0 to 0.
