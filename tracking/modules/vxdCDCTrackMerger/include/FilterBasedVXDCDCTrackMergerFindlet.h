  /**
   * Findlet for combining VXD and CDC tracks.
   *
   * The workflow has three steps:
   *
   * 1) All possible combinations between cdc and vxd tracks are fed into a filter (e.g. a MVA filter).
   *    A best candidate selection is performed.
   * 2) If (extrapolate is true and mergeAndExtrapolate is true) or (extrapolate is false),
   *    those combinations that survive the filter are immediately merged. In the following, only the
   *    remaining tracks without a partner are used.
   * 3) If extrapolate is true, the remaining combinations (either those that survived the filter if
   *    mergeAndExtrapolate is false ot those that do not have a partner if mergeAndExtrapolate is true)
   *    are extrapolated onto the CDC innter wall and their distance is compared.
   *    Again, a best candidate selection is performed.
