-----------------------------------------

Purpose of this script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This python script is used for the training and validation of the classifier of
the MVA-based result filter of the CDCToSVDSeedCKF, which combines tracks that
were found by the CDC and SVD standalone tracking algorithms.

To avoid mistakes, b2luigi is used to create a task chain for a combined training and
validation of all classifiers.

The order of the b2luigi tasks in this script is as follows (top to bottom):
* Two tasks to create input samples for training and testing (``GenerateSimTask`` and
``SplitNMergeSimTask``). The ``SplitNMergeSimTask`` takes a number of events to be
generated and a number of events per task to reduce runtime. It then divides the total
number of events by the number of events per task and creates as ``GenerateSimTask`` as
needed, each with a specific random seed, so that in the end the total number of
training and testing events are simulated. The individual files are then combined
by the SplitNMergeSimTask into one file each for training and testing.
* The ``ResultRecordingTask`` writes out the data used for training of the MVA.
* The ``CKFResultFilterTeacherTask`` trains the MVA, FastBDT per default, with a
given set of FastBDT options.
* The ``ValidationAndOptimisationTask`` uses the trained weight files and cut values
provided to run the tracking chain with the weight file under test, and also
runs the tracking validation.
* Finally, the ``MainTask`` is the "brain" of the script. It invokes the
``ValidationAndOptimisationTask`` with the different combinations of FastBDT options
and cut values on the MVA classifier output.

Due to the dependencies, the calls of the task are reversed. The MainTask
calls the ``ValidationAndOptimisationTask`` with different FastBDT options and cut
values, and the ``ValidationAndOptimisationTask`` itself calls the required teacher,
training, and simulation tasks.

b2luigi: Understanding the steering file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All trainings and validations are done in the correct order in this steering
file. For the purpose of creating a dependency graph, the `b2luigi
<https://b2luigi.readthedocs.io>`_ python package is used, which extends the
`luigi <https://luigi.readthedocs.io>`_ package developed by spotify.

Each task that has to be done is represented by a special class, which defines
which defines parameters, output files and which other tasks with which
parameters it depends on.  For example a teacher task, which runs
``basf2_mva_teacher.py`` to train the classifier, depends on a data collection
task which runs a reconstruction and writes out track-wise variables into a root
file for training.  An evaluation/validation task for testing the classifier
requires both the teacher task, as it needs the weightfile to be present, and
also a data collection task, because it needs a dataset for testing classifier.

The final task that defines which tasks need to be done for the steering file to
finish is the ``MainTask``. When you only want to run parts of the
training/validation pipeline, you can comment out requirements in the Master
task or replace them by lower-level tasks during debugging.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This steering file relies on b2luigi_ for task scheduling. It can be installed
via pip::

    python3 -m pip install [--user] b2luigi

Use the ``--user`` option if you have not rights to install python packages into
your externals (e.g. because you are using cvmfs) and install them in
``$HOME/.local`` instead.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of command line arguments, the b2luigi script is configured via a
``settings.json`` file. Open it in your favorite text editor and modify it to
fit to your requirements.

Usage
~~~~~

You can test the b2luigi without running it via::

    python3 cdc_and_svd_ckf_merger_mva_training.py --dry-run
    python3 cdc_and_svd_ckf_merger_mva_training.py --show-output

This will show the outputs and show potential errors in the definitions of the
luigi task dependencies.  To run the the steering file in normal (local) mode,
run::

    python3 cdc_and_svd_ckf_merger_mva_training.py

One can use the interactive luigi web interface via the central scheduler
which visualizes the task graph while it is running. Therefore, the scheduler
daemon ``luigid`` has to run in the background, which is located in
``~/.local/bin/luigid`` in case b2luigi had been installed with ``--user``. For
example, run::

    luigid --port 8886

Then, execute your steering (e.g. in another terminal) with::

    python3 cdc_and_svd_ckf_merger_mva_training.py --scheduler-port 8886

To view the web interface, open your webbrowser enter into the url bar::

    localhost:8886

If you don't run the steering file on the same machine on which you run your web
browser, you have two options:

    1. Run both the steering file and ``luigid`` remotely and use
       ssh-port-forwarding to your local host. Therefore, run on your local
       machine::

           ssh -N -f -L 8886:localhost:8886 <remote_user>@<remote_host>

    2. Run the ``luigid`` scheduler locally and use the ``--scheduler-host <your
       local host>`` argument when calling the steering file

Accessing the results / output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All output files are stored in a directory structure in the ``result_path``. The
directory tree encodes the used b2luigi parameters. This ensures reproducibility
and makes parameter searches easy. Sometimes, it is hard to find the relevant
output files. You can view the whole directory structure by running ``tree
<result_path>``. Ise the unix ``find`` command to find the files that interest
you, e.g.::

    find <result_path> -name "*.root" # find all ROOT files
