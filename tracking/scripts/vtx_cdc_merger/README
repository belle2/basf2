VTX CDC track merger

The Belle II tracking produces for each event a list of tracks in VTX and CDC using 
standalone subdetector tracking. The list of CDC tracks is enhanced by additional CDC
tracks created by extending VTX tracks into the CDC. The newly found CDC track gets a 
relation to the original VTX track. The same game may be played starting with the CDC 
tracks. The VTX CDC merger forms a final set of merged tracks by combining the VTX and 
CDC parts. At the same time, the tracks get cleaned from fake tracks and curlers.
