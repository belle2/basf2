     *  Therefore the memory has to be provided by other means and should not be moved \n
     *  as long as you want to access the neighbors of items via this object. Also the \n
     *  retrival works solely by the memory address of the items. So you have to give \n
     *  the \a same objects for retrival of neighbors and not just one comparing equal \n
     *  to it. Internally the neighbor relations are sorted by their pointer address first and \n
     *  by the weight second.

       *
       *  Often on faces the problem of having to build a neighborhood relation between elements of the \n
       *  same kind. To find suitable neighbors in a general container it would take an amount of time \n
       *  proportional to n*n to compare all available elements to each other, which is often to long. \n
       *  However if we can sort the sequence we can improve look up speed to an element by a great deal. \n
       *  All tracking hits we want to build neighborhoods for are therefore already made sortable. \n
       *  But the improved look up speed only helps if the neighbors are not scattered around randomly over \n
       *  the sorted range but are close together in a specific section of the range. The time complexity drops \n
       *  than to n*log n + n * m, where n is the number of elements in the collection and m the expected number \n
       *  of neighbors.
       *
       *  Since we already sorted out the arrangement of hits during their creation, we have to define \n
       *  the region where to look for neighbors. We keep the general logic for look up the same \n
       *  but vary the definition of what a neighborhood is supposed to be we factor the later out into \n
       *  a strategy object called the RelationFilter with the following interface methods : \n
       *  * getPossibleNeighbors(item, itBegin, itEnd) returns a range iterable object of items
       *    which are possible neighbors \n
       *
       *  * operator(Relation<AItem>) checks every neighboring object and returns a weight to
       *    indicate the quality of the neighbor. \n
       *    It returns NOT_A_NEIGHBOR (NaN) in case the neighbor is invalid and shall not be saved.\n
