     * overriding one of the match()-functions in a derived class.
     *
     * Most likely, the full stack is used as follows:
     * * match two lists of elements (Collectors and Collections) resulting in a list of weighted relations among those
     * * select only some relations using a certain criteria (this is where the difference between Collector and Collections
     *   comes into place)
     * * add the found relations by absorbing the collection items into the collector items.
     *
     * Please note that the CollectionItems are therefore const whereas the CollectorItems are not. All the passed
     * WeightedRelations lists must be sorted.
     *
     * Most of the provided selectors are built to match many collection items to one collector item.
