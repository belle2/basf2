     *  The later readily indicates a flight direction from the reconstructed hit, if a tangential approch of \n
     *  the trajectory to the drift circle is assumed.

     *  Finally we want to estimate the travel distance to z coordinate relation of the particle trajectory. \n
     *  Therefore the three dimensional reconstructed hit stores the travel distance as seen from the xy projection \n
     *  ( perpS ) it took to get to hit. This variable can be calculated from the trajectory circle fitted in \n
     *  the two dimensional tracking as the arc length.
