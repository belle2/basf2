     *  Class representing a three dimensional reconstructed hit.
     *  A recohit represents a likely point where the particle went through. It is always assoziated with a
     *  wire hit it seeks to reconstruct. The reconstructed point is stored as an absolut position from the
     *  origin / interaction point. In addition the reconstructed hit takes a right left passage information
     *  which indicates if the hit wire lies to the right or to the left of the particle trajectory causing the hit.
     *  The later readily indicates a flight direction from the reconstructed hit, if a tangential approch of
     *  the trajectory to the drift circle is assumed.
     *
     *  Finally we want to estimate the travel distance to z coordinate relation of the particle trajectory.
     *  Therefore the three dimensional reconstructed hit stores the travel distance as seen from the xy projection
     *  ( arcLength2D ) it took to get to hit. This variable can be calculated from the trajectory circle fitted in
     *  the two dimensional tracking as the arc length.
