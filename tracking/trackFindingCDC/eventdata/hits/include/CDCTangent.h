    /// Class representating a linear track piece between two oriented wire hits.
    /** A tangent is an approximation of the possible trajectory between two oriented wire hits.
     *  The approximation is obtained by constructing a tangent between two drift circles of the wire hits
     *  (in the reference xy projection).\n
     *  Generally maximal four tangents are possible. So to uniquely define a tangent we have
     *  to give additional information how it passes relativ to the drift circles. This right left
     *  passage information indicates if the related wire hit should lie to the right of to the left
     *  of the tangent. The four possible combinations are then\n
     *  (ERightLeft::c_Right, ERightLeft::c_Right), (ERightLeft::c_Right, ERightLeft::c_Left),\n
     *  (ERightLeft::c_Left, ERightLeft::c_Right), (ERightLeft::c_Left,ERightLeft::c_Left).\n
     *  To represent the tangent this class uses a ParameterLine2D. The touch points to the two drift circles
     *  are located at(0) for the first and at(1) for the second.
     *  The tangent has therefor a sense of what is forward and can be reversed if necessary.
     *  Generally tangents are only a good approximation between neighboring wire hits.*/
