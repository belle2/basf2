     *  @name Structured creation of neighborhoods
     *
     *  Often one faces the problem of having to build a graph between elements of the \n
     *  same kind. To find suitable neighbors in a general container it would take an amount of time \n
     *  proportional to n*n to compare all available elements to each other, which is often to long. \n
     *  However if we can sort the sequence we can improve look up speed to an element by a great deal. \n
     *  All tracking hits / segments / tracks for which we want to build graphs are therefore made sortable. \n
     *  But the improved look up speed only helps if the neighbors are not scattered around randomly over \n
     *  the sorted range but are close together in a specific section of the range. The time complexity drops \n
     *  than to n*log n + n * m, where n is the number of elements in the collection and m the expected number \n
     *  of neighbors.
     *
     *  Since we already sorted out the arrangement of hits / segments / tracks during their creation, we have to define \n
     *  the region where to look for neighbors. We keep the general logic for look up the same \n
     *  but vary the definition of what a neighborhood is supposed to be we factor the later out into \n
     *  a strategy object called the RelationFilter with the following interface methods : \n
     *  * getPossibleNeighbors(item, itBegin, itEnd) returns a range iterable object of items
     *    which are possible neighbors \n
     *
     *  * operator(Relation<AItem>) checks every neighboring object and returns a weight to
     *    indicate the quality of the neighbor. \n
     *    It returns NaN in case the neighbor is invalid and shall not be saved.\n
