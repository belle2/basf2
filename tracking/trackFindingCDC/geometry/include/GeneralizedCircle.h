     *  A generalized circle.

     *  Makes a smooth generalization from a two dimensional normal line
     *  ( like Line2D ) to a circle.
     *
     *  The parameterisation is best suited for low curvature circle. The representation takes four
     *  parameters. They correspond to the normal circle parameters like \n
     *  n0 = (m_x*m_x + m_y*m_y - r*r)/2r \n
     *  n1 = -m_x/r \n
     *  n2 = -m_y/r \n
     *  n3 = 1/2r \n
     *  where the normalization condtion is n1*n1 + n2*n2 - 4 * n0 * n3 = 1.
     *  The overall sign is fixed in the following way:
     *  If the last parameter is positiv the circle is assummed to be orientated counterclockwise
     *  else the circle is assummed to be orientated clockwise.
     *  The parameters n1 and n2 are indeed a vector in two dimensions and
     *  we keep them stored as Vector2D.
     *  Additionally we can represent a line with same parameters by setting n3 = 0. Compare Line2D.
