     *  Class representating a sense wire layer in the central drift chamber.
     *  This class represents a CDC layer as a range of wires. \n
     *  The range is sorted with increasing wire ids for maximal fast look up. \n
     *  It offers methods for checking the validity of wire ids, a getter for the wires in this layer \n
     *  additionally to be iterable as a range. \n
     *  Furthermore it stores averaged geometrical quantities combined from the wires it contains. \n
     *  The class does not provide the memory for the wires by itself. \n
     *  It uses iterators into a vector of CDCWires. \n
     *  The vector of CDCWires is normally provided by the CDCWireTopology object instance. \n
     *  Note : All possible layer object are stored in the CDCWireTopology, \n
     *  which you can get with the static getInstance() functions. \n
     *  There is rarely a need for constructing a layer object and \n
     *  it should be avoided.
