  /**
    A root tool that compares two Sectormaps (local root files) and produces some statistics output. Yes we old people do
    use root. So get over it and open a root session to create an Object to let its magic unfold.
    This tool assumes that both sectormaps use the same setup (i.e. number of sectors on sensor, and filter configuration). It still may
    work with slightly different filters as long as the naming did not change. But if the number of sectors on sensor is different the
    matching of sectors will not work and the results may become misleading!

    The output will be several plots comparing the filter cuts (min, max) for each of the contained filters. In
    addition a simple counting of sector connections is provided.

    Per default only sector combinations which are matched between both sectormaps are drawn.
    If the option unmatchedEntries==true is set when calling CompareMaps only the sector combinations which are not matched from the first sector map are plotted.
