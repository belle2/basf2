  /**
   * Algorithm class to handle the fitting of RecoTrack objects. The fitting of reco tracks implies non-trivial synchronisation,
   * so you should only use this class for fitting RecoTrack instances.
   *
   * After having created a RecoTrack and added hits to it, you can fit the RecoTrack.
   *
   *   RecoTrack recoTrack;
   *   ... add CDC hits etc. ...
   *   ... set seeds etc. ...
   *
   * The standard case
   * -----------------
   *
   * Typical use case if you do not use the fitter modules but want to fit in your own module.
   *
   * TrackFitter trackFitter;
   * trackFitter.fit(recoTrack);
   *
   * -> Create measurements if hit content has changed (dirty flag)
   * -> Fit (again) if (a) no fit result present or (b) hit content has changed (dirty flag)
   *
   * Non-default fitter
   * ------------------
   *
   * May be used if you know that the default fitting algorithm is not suited for your use case.
   * Please be aware, that the following modules may use your fit results, if the hit content is not changed,
   * although they may expect a "default"-fit.
   * Because the currently present fit results were probably created with the default fitter, the fit is executed always (and not only when the hit content has changed).
   *
   * ATTENTION: If the hit content did not change (the dirty flag is not set), the track will not be refitted later! Future modules may expect a default fit!
   *
   * TrackFitter trackFitter;
   * trackFitter.resetFitter( ... );
   * trackFitter.fit(recoTrack);
   *
   * -> Create measurements if hit content has changed (dirty flag)
   * -> Always fitted
   *
   * Non-default track representations
   * ---------------------------------
   *
   * Useful if you know you have an electron/etc. instead of a pion. Please make sure that the cardinal representation points to the correct representation - especially when you
   * try out non-RKTrackRep objects.
   * ATTENTION: Once a track representation is added to the track, it will always be also used when fitting! If you do not want this, remove this track representation again.
   *
   * TrackFitter trackFitter;
   * // Maybe set other fit algorithm.
   * trackFitter.fit(recoTrack, particleType);
   * or
   * trackFitter.fit(recoTrack, trackRep);
   *
   * -> Create measurements if hit content has changed (dirty flag)
   * -> Fit (again) if (a) added track representation is new or (b) hit content has changed (dirty flag) or (c) you use a non-default fitter.
   *
   * Non-default measurements
   * ------------------------
   *
   * This is only needed in very rare cases, when you want to transform the added hits into measurement points for your special use case e.g. alignment or VXD-dEdX-momentum estimation.
   *
   * ATTENTION: Again, please be aware that future modules may expect fit results from a default fit!
   *
   * TrackFitter trackFitter;
   * // Possibility 1
   * trackFitter.resetMeasurementCreators({ cdcMeasurementCreatorSharedPointer1, cdcMeasurementCreatorSharedPointer2, ...},
   *                                     { svdMeasurementCreatorSharedPointer1, ...},
   *                                     { pxdMeasurementCreatorSharedPointer1, ...},
   *                                     { additionalMeasurementCreatorSharedPointer1, ...})
   * // Possibility 2
   * measurementAdder.resetMeasurementCreatorsUsingFactories( mapOfCreatorNamesAndSettingsForCDC,
   *                                                          mapOfCreatorNamesAndSettingsForSVD,
   *                                                          mapOfCreatorNamesAndSettingsForPXD,
   *                                                          mapOfCreatorNamesAndSettingsForAdditionalMeasurements )
   *
   * // Maybe set other fit algorithm.
   * trackFitter.fit(recoTrack);
   * // or maybe use a different track representation/particle hypothesis.

   * -> Always recreate all measurements (not only when hit content has changed).
   * -> Always refit (not only when using non default parameters or hit content has changed or track representation is new).
   *
   * Because the different cases are rather complicated, there is a flow chart available.
   * TODO: Create flow chart.
