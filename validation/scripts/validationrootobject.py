class RootObject:

    """!
    Wraps a ROOT object (either a histogram or an n-tuple) together with the
    available meta-information about it.
    Storing the information in a dictionary is necessary to make the objects
    searchable, i.e. implement a function that can return for example all
    objects from a certain revision.

    @var data: A dict with all information about the Root-object
    @cvar revision: The revision to which the object belongs to
    @var package: The package to which the object belongs to
    @var rootfile: The root file to which the object belongs to
    @var key: The key (more precisely: the name of the key) which the object
        has within the root file
    @cvar object: The root object itself
    @var type: The type, i.e. whether its a histogram or an n-tuple
    @cvar description: The description, what the histogram/n-tuple contains
    @cvar check: A brief description how the histogram or the values should
        look like
    @var contact: A contact person for this histogram/n-tuple
    @cvar date: The date of the object (identical with the date of its rootfile)
    @cvar is_reference: Boolean value if it is an object from a reference file
        or not

        The constructor. Sets the element up and store the information in a
        dict, but also sets up object variables for simplified access.

        @param revision: The revision of the object, e.g. 'release-00-04-01'
        @param package: The package of the object, e.g. 'analysis'
        @param rootfile: The absolute path to the ROOT file that contains
                this object
        @param key: The key of the object, which is basically its name.
                Example: 'P_Eff_k_e'. For each revision, there should be one
                object with the same key.
        @param root_object: The ROOT object itself. Storing works only for
                histograms.
        @param root_object_type: The type of the object. Possible values are
                'TH1' (1D histogram), 'TH2' (2D histogram), and 'TNtuple'
        @param date: The date when the containing revision folder was last
                modified. Important to find the most recent object.
        @param description: A short description of what is displayed in the
                plot. May also contain LaTeX-Code (enclosed in $...$),
                which will later be parsed by MathJax
        @param check: A short description of how the data in the plot should
                look like, i.e. for example the target location of a peak etc.
        @param contact: A name or preferably an e-mail address of the person
                who is responsible for this plot and may be contacted in case
                of problems
        @param metaoptions: Meta-options for the plot, e.g. 'colz' for histo-
                grams, or log-scale for the axes, etc.
        @param is_reference: A boolean value telling if an object is a
                reference object or a normal plot/n-tuple object from a
                revision. Possible Values: True for reference objects,
                False for revision objects.
