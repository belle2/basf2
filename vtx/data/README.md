# Available geometries for VTX

Currently, the recommended ones are:
- VTX-CMOS5-staggered-L3mod.xml
- VTX-CMOS6-staggered-L3mod.xml
These contain the latest dimensions of the sensor, individual sensors are implemented with proper gap between them and the oVTX layers are in staggered structure.

Modifications being explored:
- VTX-CMOS6-staggered-L3mod-2xL12.xml
- VTX-CMOS6-staggered-L3mod-3xL12.xml
These are modified version of the recommended geometries. nxL12 represents that the material budget of the the Layers 1 and 2 is modified to be 0.n% X0 instead of the standard 0.1% X0.


Old and depriciated geometries:
- VTX-CMOS5.xml
- VTX-CMOS5-L3mod.xml
These were used for the results shown in CDR, but not considered realistic anymore.

Not fully validated:
- VTX-CMOS5-staggered.xml
- VTX-CMOS6.xml
