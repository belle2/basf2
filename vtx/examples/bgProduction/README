This folder contains shell scripts for producing background overlay files for the uprgade Belle II detector w/o PXD+SVD and w/ VTX. 
The scripts are intended to be run on KEKCC. 

Create soft link input to SADFiles. The latest SAD samples that were used for the nominal phase3 17th background campaign are at 
/group/belle2/BGcampaigns/SAD/forG4/*_lattest_lattice.root (as of 28/01/2020).

>>ln -s /group/belle2/BGcampaigns/SAD/forG4/ input

Create mixing sets with VTX detector to be used for overlay file production. Always a good idea to look into the scripts to see how many 
sets are produced (default=1) and which upgrade geometry variant is produced (default=CMOS 7 layers).  

>>bash goOther-phase3.sh
>>bash goBBBrem-phase3.sh


Create overlay files on KEKCC running the script goOverlay-phase3.sh. Need to set BELLE2_BACKGROUND_MIXING_DIR in the bash script to point 
to the mixing sets produced above were put. 

>>bash goOverlay-phase3.sh
