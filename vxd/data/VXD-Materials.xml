    <!--
         DockBox Material is kind of sketchy at the moment:
         Design shows a target weight of around 4.5kg but the contributions by different
         Materials are not easily known. For PXD we assume around 1.2kg of this to be cables
         which we now assume 50% PVC and 50% insulation. So in the End we want
         3.3kg Al, 0.6kg Cu, 0.6kg P.V.C
         Now just apply fancy scaling of how much volume would be occupied using the standard
         Elements and fill the rest with air

         For now just assume the same weights as for PXD. PXD box is a bit tighter in packing.
         But since SVD crate has copper cooling plate the amount of copper is probably higher.
